# Project ETERNAL WINTER (20/25 chapters complete)

## What is this?

This is an in-development buildfiles hack for FE8 by Devisio. Started in 2020, the project began as a well to hone my programming, game development, and art skills.
The hack features a 20 chapter campaign, many mechanical changes using tons of custom ASM/C, entirely custom maps, characters and story, and almost completely unique art and music mostly made by me. theres also coffee

## Patch

1. Download the Repo, throw in a clean FE8U ROM named FE8_clean.gba, run MAKE_HACK_full, obtain .ups file and built game. I'll upload .ups files in Releases when the time comes.
2. Download link via the thread: https://feuniverse.us/t/fe8-eternal-winter-20-chapters-acts-1-and-2-complete/15815
