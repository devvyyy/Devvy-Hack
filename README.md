# Project Eternal Winter (18/25 complete)

## What is this?

This is an in-development buildfiles hack for FE8 by Devisio. Started in 2020, the project began as a well to hone my programming, game development, and art skills.
The hack features many mechanical changes, tons of custom ASM, custom maps and story, and almost completely unique art and music mostly made by me. theres also coffee

## Patch

1. Download the Repo, throw in a clean FE8U ROM named FE8_clean.gba, run MAKE_HACK_full, obtain .ups file and built game. I'll upload .ups files in Releases when the time comes.
2. Download link via the thread: https://feuniverse.us/t/fe8-eternal-winter-18-chapters-act-1-complete-act-2-gameplay-complete/15815
