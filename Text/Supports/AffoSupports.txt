[Right]
Affogato![.6] I barely could[N]
keep up with ya[Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
You need something?[AN]

[Right]
I'm curious.[.6] Ya seem to be quite the[N]
traveler,[.4] friend.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sort of.[AN]

[Right]
[Pause]Tell me more,[.4] eh?[.6] I've always[N]
wanted to go beyond our borders.[AN]
But alas![.6] I've been stuck in my village,[.4][N]
or the castles,[.4] or on the battlefield[Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
It's not that exciting.[.6] All you[N]
see in Ideon is snow everywhere.[AN]

[Right]
Still,[.4] The idea of discovering new lands and[N]
meeting new folks is quite alluring.[AN]
Before I joined the royal guard,[.4] I've[N]
never set foot outside my village![AN]
Everyone I knew was from my small village.[.6][N]
I even met my wife there[Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
If you want new sights,[.4] how about you[N]
come with me on a hunt in the forest?[AN]
Maybe put on a sweater instead of[N]
lugging around armor[.4] though[Beat][AN]
I'm afraid the clanking will[N]
scare the animals away.[AN]

[Right]
That sounds wonderful![AN]
And like[Beat] I'll pack a sturdy[N]
pair 'o boots,[.4] eh?[AN]

[Pause]Something like that.[.6] [ToggleSmile]I'm[N]
looking forward to it.[AN][ToggleSmile][X]

[MidRight]
Affogato.[.4] If I may.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sir.[AN]

[MidRight]
I needed to catch up with[N]
you on something.[AN]
We don't usually see hunters join[N]
the Wreyvian army.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Is that so?[AN]

[MidRight]
Aeteria's lands are richer and full[N]
of dense forests outside the city-[AN]
exactly like Wreyvine's royal court.[.6N]
Hunters are more common in Aeteria.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I didn't know that.[AN]
My mother was an Aeterian.[.6][N]
My father was from Wreyvine.[AN]
Mother taught me how to hunt.[.6][N]
They died before I moved here.[AN]
That's all I remember of[N]
them,[.4] really.[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh,[.4] I see.[.6] I'm glad you're[N]
here with us now.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Same to you,[.4] Sir.[AN]

[MidRight]
Hey.[.6] Your form is off.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sorry.[.6] I'll work on it.[AN]

[MidRight]
It's nothing to apologize for.[AN]
I heard all about your archery exploits[N]
in the training grounds.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I can shoot a bow,[.4] yes.[AN]

[MidRight]
I'm wondering.[.6] Where did you learn[N]
how to use a bow?[AN]

[MidLeft]
We can discuss this after[N]
the battle.[AN]

[MidRight]
Just answer the question.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I used to live in the Aeterian[N]
woodlands,[.4] or[Beat] I think I did.[AN]

[MidRight]
You think you did?[.6] Don't play[N]
games with me.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Don't be so intrusive.[.6] I don't remember.[.6][N]
My past consists of scattered memories.[AN]

[MidRight]


Really,[.4] now[Beat]?[AN] Is that why I see[N]
you chronicling in your journal? I-[AN]

[MidLeft]
Is that all?[.6] [Pause]Sorry,[.4] Iâ€™m in[N]
a bit of a hurry.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace]

[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Hey![.6] Affogato![AN]
