[Right]
Affogato![.6] I barely could[N]
keep up with ya[Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
You need something?[AN]

[Right]
I'm curious.[.6] Ya seem to be quite the[N]
traveler,[.4] friend.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sort of.[AN]

[Right]
[Pause]Tell me more,[.4] eh?[.6] I've always[N]
wanted to go beyond our borders.[AN]
But alas![.6] I've been stuck in my village,[.4][N]
or the castles,[.4] or on the battlefield[Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
It's not that exciting.[.6] All you[N]
see in Ideon is snow everywhere.[AN]

[Right]
Still,[.4] The idea of discovering new lands and[N]
meeting new folks is quite alluring.[AN]
Before I joined the royal guard,[.4] I've[N]
never set foot outside my village![AN]
Everyone I knew was from my small village.[.6][N]
I even met my wife there[Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
If you want new sights,[.4] how about you[N]
come with me on a hunt in the forest?[AN]
Maybe put on a sweater instead of[N]
lugging around armor[.4] though[Beat][AN]
I'm afraid the clanking will[N]
scare the animals away.[AN]

[Right]
That sounds wonderful![AN]
And like[Beat] I'll pack a sturdy[N]
pair 'o boots,[.4] eh?[AN]

[Pause]Something like that.[.6] [ToggleSmile]I'm[N]
looking forward to it.[AN][ToggleSmile][X]

[MidRight]
Affogato.[.4] If I may.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sir.[AN]

[MidRight]
I needed to catch up with[N]
you on something.[AN]
We don't usually see hunters join[N]
the Wreyvian army.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Is that so?[AN]

[MidRight]
Aeteria's lands are richer and full[N]
of dense forests outside the city.[AN]
Hunters are commonplace there.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I didn't know that.[AN]
My mother was an Aeterian.[.6][N]
My father was from Wreyvine.[AN]
Mother taught me how to hunt.[.6][N]
They died before I moved here.[AN]
That's all I remember of[N]
them,[.4] really.[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh,[.4] I see.[.6] I'm glad you're[N]
here with us now.[A][X]

Your form is off.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sorry.[.6] I'll work on it.[AN]

[MidRight]
You move as if you're on[N]
a mount[Beat][AN]
How do you do it?[AN]
