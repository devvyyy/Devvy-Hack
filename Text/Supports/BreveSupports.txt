Ansgar,[.4] Sir.[.6] How are the[N]
little ones?[AN]

[Right]
[ToggleSmile]Oh,[.4] hey buddy![.6][N]
They're doin' great.[AN]
I actually received a letter from[N]
my wife a few moons ago.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Aye,[.4] that's good to hear.[.6][N]
Any good news?[AN]

[Right]
All three of 'em are all workin' to[N]
become armor knights.[AN]
Just like me![.6] Ain't that[N]
the sweetest thing,[.4] eh?[AN]
Reminds me-[.4]I gotta write some[N]
letters later[Beat][AN]
Breve,[.4] my good sir.[.6] Can you bake[N]
some pastries for them?[AN]

[MidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]Just like the old times,[.4] huh?[.6][N]
Sure thing.[AN][ToggleSmile]
But recently,[.4] I've been struggling[N]
lots with baking.[AN]
I can't get the perfect loaf,[.4] no matter[N]
how hard I try![AN]
It's truly infuriating[Beat][.6][N]
Ansgar[Beat] What am I to do?[AN]

[Right]
Hey,[.4] my kids'll eat anythin'-[.4] [ToggleSmile]that's[N]
one thing they inherited from me,[.4] eh?[AN][ToggleSmile]
And if it makes you feel any better,[.4][N]
we're fans of your pastries.[AN]
I'm sure they'd love to have[N]
your baking again.[AN]

[MidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]Aye,[.4] if you say so[Beat] I'm happy[N]
to bake for your family.[AN][ToggleSmile]

Sir Ulrich.[AN]

[MidRight]
Good day,[.4] Breve.[.6] [Pause]What's[N]
with the basket of bread?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh,[.4] these are pastries I[N]
baked for the army.[AN]
Do you want a piece or two?[.6][N]
It's healthy.[AN]

[MidRight]
Sure.[.6] Is that all you[N]
came here for?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh,[.4] of course not.[.6] I had a[N]
question for you as well.[AN]
You've been a paladin for as long[N]
as I remember.[AN]
But your steed is different-[.4][N]
what's this one's name?[AN]

[MidRight]
Her name is Kreiss.[.6][N]
How do you not know this?[AN]

[MidLeft]
[Pause]My apologies,[.4] Sir.[AN]

[MidRight]
[ToggleSmile]I'm just messing with you.[AN][ToggleSmile]
A knight must remain dutiful[,] but you can[N]
afford to loosen up from time to time.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Why,[.4] I must be formal![.6]I'm speaking[N]
to my superior commander.[AN]
And on the battlefield[,] nonetheless.[.6N]
There's no room for error.[AN]
Like my mother and her grandfather before[N]
her[,] I am a knight of Wreyvine.[AN]
That's all I am.[AN]

[MidRight]
And a pretty competent baker,[.4] too.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Please,[.4] Sir[Beat] It's disgraceful[N]
that I'm indulging[Beat] in such things.[AN]

[MidRight]
Loosen up,[.4] Breve.[AN]
I myself am a fan[N]
of needlework.[AN]
Well[,] the point is that it's[N]
okay to have hobbies.[.6] Really.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I[Beat] suppose[,] Sir.[AN]

[MidRight]
You can be known for things[N]
alongside your knighthood.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Oh,[.4] Sir Breve the Baker![.6N]
Bards will sing your name![AN]
[Pause]Something like that.[AN][ToggleSmile]

[MidLeft]
Uh[,] sure[Beat] Oh![.6] An enemy![.6N]
I'll see you later[,] Sir.[AN]

[MidRight]
H-[.4]Hey,[.4] you![.6] Watch out![AN]

 [MidLeft]
Oh![.6] Barely moved out of[N]
the way of that one.[AN]
That is my error.[AN]

[MidRight]
You ARE Wreyvian[,] right[Beat]?[AN]

[MidLeft]
What kind of question is that?[.6N]
Of course.[.6] I'm Breve[,] for the matter.[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh[,] my sincerest apologies[,] Sir Breve.[AN]
It's good to meet you.[.6] I'm Yory.[AN]

[MidLeft]
It's good to meet you.[.6] So,[.4] shall[N]
we go back to battle?[AN]

[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Wait![.6] I'm collecting any potential[N]
problems that people face.[AN]
It's so I can design tools to[N]
circumvent them.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I don't have any problems.[.6] Nothing[N]
specific to me[,] anyways.[AN]

[MidRight]
None[Beat]?[.6] Like,[.4] absolutely[N]
nothing at all?[AN]
I'd say [OpenQuote]constantly facing death" is[N]
an important issue in this army.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Aye.[.6] It is one shared by all.[AN]
And I doubt you can invent a tool[N]
that[Beat] prevents death.[AN]

[MidRight]
What?![.6] We'll see about that![AN]
