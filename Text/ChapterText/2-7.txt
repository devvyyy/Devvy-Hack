[ML][Jaye]
Everything alright[,] Chiff?[.6] The march is[N]
about to begin.[AN]

[MR]
I'm alright.[.6] It's just[Beat] everything feels[N]
so distant.[.6] We're closer than ever to Wreyvine[,][N]
yes[,] but[Beat][AN]
What happens after this?[.6] We elude the[N]
lancepoint of Major Hayes[Beat] and we fall into[N]
the jaws of kingdom soldiers?[AN][CSS]

[ML][MoveFarLeft]
[L][Verna]
That won't happen[,] Ser.[AN]

[MR]
What makes you so sure?[AN]

[L]
We are strong.[.6] Even when faced with[N]
the Imperial Generals[,] we never faltered.[6N]
This is just more of the same.[AN]

[FL]
We[Beat] We can't go back now[,] leader.[.6][N]
Either way[,] the most we can do here is[N]
continue fighting.[AN]
We either get through or we go down[N]
with spells blazing![.6] And I dunno 'bout[N]
you[,] but we're getting through![AN]

[MR]
But[Beat][AN]

[FFL]
Are you seriously doubting yourself now?[AN]

[L][CF][Raya]
Come on[,] what's with the grim face?[6N]
After everything we've been through?[.6][N]
We're too far in for this[,] leader.[AN]
You've led us to victory time and time again.[.6][N]
The princess was right.[.6] We're strong.[6N]
There's absolutely no reason for doubt now.[an]

[FL][CF][Graham]
The night sets to the north[,] Ser.[.6][N]
This is an ample time if any to make our[N]
final march towards Wreyvine.[AN]
Bordering the bridge is an abandoned kingdom[n]
fortress we will take refuge in.[.6][n]
I agree with the Captain's sentiment,[AN]
but these are unprecedented times.[AN][C]
Major Haye and his forces are surrounding[N]
the premises.[.6] We have limited time[,] if any.[AN][C]
But the night is still:[.4] we will prevail over[N]
his forces and cross over before long.[AN]

[MR]
I understand[Beat] Alert the others.[.6][N]
We'll march at once.[AN]

Rebels![.6] I offer you but one chance at[N]
surrender.[.6] Lay down your arms[Beat] and[N]
I shall lower mine in turn.[AN]
You have disturbed the peace of the holy[N]
empire[Beat] disrupted the order and desecrated[N]
the Imperial holy accord[Beat][AN]
But stand down now[,] and you will not lose[N]
your lives![.6] I offer you all a fair trial![6N]
If nothing else[,] surrender your leader![6N]
She is a danger to the empire[,] to Aeteria's[N]
very people[Beat][AN][C]
She must not be allowed to live.[AN]

Ain't no way we're letting you have her![AN][CSS][MoveFarRight]

[R][Chiffon]
It's alright[,] Raial[Beat] If we fall[Beat][N]
I will take full responsibility as the[N]
leader of the Liberation Army.[AN]

[FR]
Tsch.[.6] That ain't happening[,] leader.[6N]
Not on my watch.[.6] Nobody is going[N]
to sacrifice themselves today.[AN]
We won't let some imperial lapdog take our[N]
lives and our home away from us.[.6][N]
There's always a way to prevail.[AN]

[ML][Graham]
Surrender was never an option.[.6] Leader[,] has[N]
your honing of your latent powers not[N]
been for this?[AN]
Send a message to the empire.[.6][N]
Extirpate the imperial forces.[.6][N]
Do not let a single one escape![AN]

[R]
Of course[,] Reverend.[.6] This is the only way.[6N]
Never look back.[AN]

Stay clear of the Serpent's mark.[6N]
It is not just a smirch on hallowed ground.[.6][N]
[Pause]It is laid with oil.[AN]

Come what may[,] we will raze the border until[N]

Let's see how you handle this.[AN]

[MR]
Why do you continue?[.6] The Emperor's awry rule[N]

Silence![.6] I will not hear vile from a traitor![.6][N]

I clawed out of Wreyvine with stained hands.[AN]
I owe it to the empire for digging me out[N]

[MR]
I wanted to defeat you[,] Major.[.6][N]
But even I realize this is fruitless.[.6][N]
