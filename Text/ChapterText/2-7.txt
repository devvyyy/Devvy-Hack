You've come a long way since he dragged[N]
you across that bridge[,] huh?[AN]

[MR]
Heh[Beat] You could say I've been waiting[N]
for this.[AN]

[ML]
We all have, but hmm[Beat] Hey.[.6] I'm gonna give you[N]
some unsolicited advice.[AN]

[MR]
Alright[,] alright.[.6] What is it?[AN]

[ML]
Don't make this about pride.[.6] Beat the guy[N]
because you must, not because you wanna[N]
look good doing it.[AN]

[MR]
I know.[.6] I know you were skeptical of me[N]
and my powers[,] so I don't want to lose myself[N]
or go wild or anything.[AN]

[ML]
Round two.[.6] You got this[,] Chiff.[AN]

[MR]
As long as you're by my side[,] I won't let you[N]
down.[.6] I'm walking off that bridge and[N]
he's not.[AN]

[ML]
Major Hayes stands before you again[,] leader.[.6][N]
And you intend to settle your debt with[N]
him here.[AN]

[MR]
Debt?[.6] It's more like a score to settle.[AN]

[ML]
A measured revenge is no vice.[.6][N]
But do not let the past unbalance you now.[AN]

[MR]
I'm not after revenge to lose myself.[.6][N]
But I won't let him walk away again.[AN]

[ML]
Good.[.6] Use him as your stepping stone--[.4][N]
but keep your eyes on the summit.[AN]

[MR]
I'm ready[,] Reverend.[.6] This time, he falls.[6N]
I have to[Beat] It's personal.[AN]

[ML]
Personal or not,[.6] the war will remember this[N]
moment.[.6] Strike him down, and the path[N]
forward will open.[AN]

[MR]
I'll burn the whole bridge down if I have to.[AN]

[ML]
Then take this.[.6] It is made of pure ether.[6N]
I fear once we cross the bridge[,] we will[N]
encounter more of those wraiths from Arma.[AN]

[MR]
The thing feels weird[,] but alright.[.6] If it'll help[N]

Their defenses are heavily fortified[,] led by[N]
Consul Aoife of the Trinity herself.[.6] She's[N]
backed by each of the Imperial generals.[AN]

[FL]
We've gained the attention of a Consul?[.6][N]
Now we've really done it[Beat] If we can take down[N]
one of the Trinity like that[,] the empire[Beat][AN]
This new Aeteria might be closer than we[N]
ever realized![AN]

[FR]
I'm ready.[AN]

[FL]
Better be.[.6] Even after that Warden deal[,][N]
you're still standing.[.6] We got this.[AN]

[R]
Very good.[.6] If we can overtake and defeat[N]
one so grand in battle[Beat][AN]

[FR]
Graham.[.6] We[Beat] We can.[.6] We've been unstoppable[N]
thus far.[.6] As a team we fought tooth and nail[N]
to get where we are.[AN]
Major Hayes no longer stands in our way.[.6][N]
Today[Beat] We've declared total war against[N]
the empire.[AN]

[FL]
We're a little late on that[,] leader.[.6][N]
But everybody's fired up.[.6] On your signal[,][N]
we'll engage the enemy.[AN]

[R]
Yes[Beat] And we will continue to do so.[.6][N]
This is certain to be a stained and[N]
bloody battle.[AN]
But[Beat] One's eminence is determined through[N]
sacrifice.[.6] We will stake a claim to a[N]

Aeteria shall weep for the loss of[N]
a man who truly loved her.[AN]

[R]
A fool[,] he was[Beat] but even I cannot[N]
deny his selfless fealty.[AN]

[FR]
I may not have always agreed with the[N]
man[,] but none can deny he always did[N]
what he thought was best for Aeteria.[AN]

[ML]
To think the liberators are so far up[Beat][N]
That speaks to their power[Beat] Can we[N]
really face them head-on?[AN]

[FR]
There isn't much of a choice[,] Opali.[6N]
This is sure to be our last battle in Aeteria[N]
against these rebels.[AN]

Wondering about self-preservation?[6N]
Hah![.6] And I thought you too jaded[N]

Praise me.[.6] Or don't.[AN]

[FFR][MoveFarRight]
Consul Aoife[Beat] You arrive just in time for the[N]
rebels to begin their charge.[AN]

[ML]
Forgive me[,] Messel.[.6] I had to make myself a[N]
nice cup of joe for the upcoming battle.[.6][N]
Night has fallen[,] after all.[AN]
[CSS]

[FFR][MoveFarRight]
Well[,] drink up quick.[.6] The Liberators are[N]
upon us.[.6] They intend to cross the[N]
bridge and parlay with Wreyvine.[AN]

[ML]
Well[,] well[,] well.[.6] So that bunch is who[N]
they call Liberators![.6] What a small band![.6][N]
Hardly anything I'm not used to.[AN]
Honestly[,] the bridge is kinda nostalgic.[6N]
But it is a pleasure to finally meet them[N]
face to face.[.6] Bridge to bridge[,] I suppose.[AN]

[R]
Consul Aoife.[.6] The rebel forces have gained too[N]
much ground in such little time.[.6] Do you see the[N]
mercenary with the golden eyes?[AN]
That one in particular will prove to be a[N]
problem.[.6] She carries herself like a demon[N]
on the battlefield.[AN]

[ML]
Oh?[.6] Is she[,] now? We'll see.[AN]

[FFR][MoveFarRight]
The people rally behind Ser Chiffon as more[N]
than just a simple leader.[.6] She's[Beat] an idea--[.4][N]
a spark of sorts.[AN]
Weak flames die with the wind[,] but such parks[N]
do not die.[.6] They await to be reignited.[6N]
We have to extinguish their light.[AN]

[FFR][MoveRight]
Might I have a quick moment[,] Consul?[AN]

[ML]
Who am I to deny you[,] Wellington?[6N]
Be easy on me[,] though.[.6] Arriving on short[N]
notice is one of my blind spots.[AN]

[R]
The rebel forces have gained too[N]
much ground.[.6] And you underestimate the[N]
mercenary and her allies.[AN]
Those of the Order and Resistance fight[N]
with her.[.6] I knew ex-court Graham was[N]
a snake[Beat] but Yufka[,] too?![AN]
They have spawned endless chaos in our[N]
prisons and cities[,] Consul.[.6][N]
Our forces have been decimated![AN]

[ML]
Yes[,] I'm very impressed with the liberation's[N]
resume.[.6] But many can stand armed[N]
against the empire.[.6] Many more fall.[AN]
I've heard and seen the same things across[N]
my life[,] time and time again.[6N]
On this very bridge[,] even.[AN]

[FR][CF][Opal]
Your orders[,] Consul?[.6] The time has come for[N]
us to make our first move.[AN]

[ML]
Right[,] my apologies[,] Mala.[.6] I do tend to babble[,][N]
but if you want to continue our little chat[N]
after the battle[,] I would very much be open.[AN]
You all[,] move into position at once.[.6][N]
I have faith in your duties as General.[.6][N]

The enemy is about to march.[6N]

[MR]
Something's clouding my focus[,] Reverend.[AN]

[ML]
Close your eyes[,] Ser.[6N]
After everything[Beat] Where are you now?[AN]

[MR][CloseEyes][Event]

The prison where it all began.[.6][N]
Where the fallen Major locked me away.[AN]

[ML]
What do you see?[AN]

[MR]
Chains[Beat] wardens[Beat] Wardens[Beat][N]
The guards[,] not the armored guy.[6N]
Cold walls.[AN]

[ML]
You looked quite pitiful in that cell[,] Ser.[6N]
Like a caged bird.[AN]

[MR][OpenEyes]
Well[,] yeah[Beat] I remember thinking that if I[N][OpenEyes]
were to die here[,] the world would just keep[N][OpenEyes]
on turning and turning.[.6] I was nobody.[AN]

[ML]
The empire would've continued marching.[6N]
Yet[Beat] You broke free.[.6] You are unshackled[N]
from the whims of Fate.[AN]

[MR]
I know.[.6] And I will continue getting stronger[N]
until the bridge is alight.[AN]

[ML]
A tangible sign of your strength[,] is it not?[AN]

[MR]
Reverend.[.6] Can you do the same?[.6][N]
What do you see?[.6] Do we really share our[N]

What a peculiar question.[.6] I see[Beat][N][CloseEyes][FL][SendToBack][Antonius]
[ML]
the Governor.[.6] His ideals[,] his vision that led[Beat][N]
us here[Beat] His silly cap and coat.[AN]

[MR]
You don't sound very pleased[,] Reverend.[AN]

[FL][CF]
[ML][OpenEyes]
Of course.[.6] But sacrifice is a necessity.[6N][OpenEyes]
And we need to focus on you[,] not me.[.6][N][OpenEyes]

The fell Major's spear[,] and[Beat] rays of[N]
light breaching his armor.[6N]
He's nothing now.[AN]
His strength was real.[.6] His conviction was,[.4] too.[6N]
But he couldn't see the empire crumbling[N]
even as it cracked beneath his feet.[AN]

[ML]
Give him no mind[,] Chiffon.[.6][N]
You fought him in a duel[,] and you[N]
emerged the victor.[.6] That is all.[AN]

[MR]
But then[Beat] I see[Beat] The Warden.[6N]
His black armor[Beat] His[Beat] familiar battle[N]
stance.[.6] He still stands.[AN]

[ML]
[Beat]Do you believe yourself to be astray?[AN]

[MR]
I keep thinking about that moment.[.6][N]
It was so fast[,] it was like I was just[N]
another enemy to push aside for him.[AN]

[ML]
That is what cuts you deeper than his blade,[4N]
is it not?[.6] That he did not stay[N]
to finish you.[AN]

[MR]
He left me alive because I wasn't[N]
worth the kill.[AN]

[ML]
Or because he feared what you could yet[N]
become.[.6] That his role in this tale has ended[,][N]
and yours[,] Ser[,] burns brighter still.[AN]

[MR]
I see the marches through snow-covered[N]
passes.[.6] With all of you.[.6] The empire's[N]
banners burn with a faint glow.[AN][C][OpenEyes]
And[Beat] They all follow me.[AN]

[ML]
All of them fighting with you[,] waiting for[N]
the beacon that will shake the throne[N]
and bring upon a new dawn.[AN]

[MR]
I see Ideon[Beat] trapped under the Emperor's[N]
cold grip.[.6] And I see the bridge ahead of[N]
me[,] alight with blinding rain.[AN]

[ML]
Then there is no need to hesitate.[6N]
Your path has been carved through faith[N]
and by blood.[AN]

[MR][OpenEyes]
I won't hesitate.[.6] I'll tear through the[N]
last of them[Beat] And when I reach the Bastion[Beat][N]
When I reach him--[AN]

[ML]
You will destroy them[,] Ser[,] and seize everything[N]
you can.[.6] Let none of them escape[,] and[6N]

It's hard to swallow[,] huh?[.6] Getting beaten[N]
down[Beat] and having to regain your footing.[AN]

[MR]
It is.[.6] But I'm starting to think it's not[N]
because I wasn't worth the final strike.[AN]

[ML]
Yeah?[.6] I thought that was obvious.[AN]

[MR]
Maybe he saw something else.[.6][N]
Like[Beat] Maybe the fight isn't over yet.[AN]

You mean for you or for him?[AN]

For both of us.[.6] I just think[Beat] There's no way[N]
it ends there.[.6] I won't let this go.[AN]

Or she'll break. And[Beat] No.[.6] No[,] I see.[6N]
That's exactly what you want[,] isn't it?[6N]
You WANT to see her fall into despair.[AN]
You mean to push her to her limit so[N]

Her wounds will heal with time.[6N]
Aeteria's will not.[.6] Raial[,] you saw her[N]
