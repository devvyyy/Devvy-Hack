Jaye
Everything alright, Chiff? The march is about to begin.

Chiffon
Iâ€™m alright. Itâ€™s just... everything feels so distant. Weâ€™re closer than ever to Wreyvine, yes, but... What happens after this? We elude the lancepoint of Major Haye..... and we fall into the jaws of kingdom soldiers?

Jaye
That wonâ€™t happen.

Chiffon
What makes you so sure?

Jaye
We... We canâ€™t go back now, leader. Either way, the most we can do here is continue fighting. We either get through or we go down with spells blazing!

Chiffon
But...

Raya
Are you seriously doubting yourself now? After everything weâ€™ve been through? Weâ€™re too far in for this, leader. You led us to victory time and time again. Thereâ€™s absolutely no reason for doubt now.

Graham
The night sets to the north, Ser. This is an ample time if any to make our final march towards Wreyvine. Bordering the bridge is an abandoned kingdom fortress we will take refuge in. I agree with the Captainâ€™s sentiment, but these are unprecedented. Major Haye and his forces are surrounding the premises. We donâ€™t have any time leftâ€”pack up your stuff and get ready. We prevail over his forces and cross over to the kingdom or we die.

Chiffon
I understand... Alert the others. Weâ€™ll march at once.

Chiffon
Weâ€™re already surrounded... We have to fall back and form up, now!

Raya
How long have they been out here to prepare?

Graham
As expected. Our next moves will be decisiveâ€”your orders, leader?

(Haye is at the other side of the bridge)

Haye
Rebels! I offer you a chance to surrender. Lay down your arms... and I shall lower mine. You have disturbed the peace of this holy empire... disrupted the order and desecrated the Imperial holy accord... But stand down, and you will not lose your lives!

[X]

## Ch2-7Opening3
[3L]
Chiffon
Never look back.

Raya
We wonâ€™t let some imperial lapdog take our lives and our home away from us. Thereâ€™s always a way to prevail.

Graham
Surrender was never an option. Leader, has your honing of your latent powers not been for this? Send a message to the empire. Extirpate the imperial forces. Do not let a single one escape!

Chiffon
Of course, Reverend. This is the only way.

Haye
We cannot let them through. No matter the cost.

Soldier Gal ðŸ˜±
Major Haye...?

Haye
Stay clear of the Serpentâ€™s mark on the floor... They are not just a smirch on hallowed ground. It is laid with oil.

Soldier
You arenâ€™t suggesting toâ€”

Haye
No matter the costâ€”we will raze the border until naught but cinders remain if we have to!

Haye
Theyâ€™re here..... Come, rebels! See your rebellion trampled underfoot by the flames of a new Aeteria!
(he steps forward, eventing shit happens; turn on firey weather, fire map palette, etc.)

.........

Haye
It was Messelâ€™s error that keeps you alive now, witch. I overlooked it then, but here, I shall rectify such a grave mistake. To think some pest would sprout into leading the very thing destroying Aeteria...

Chiffon
Why do you continue? The Emperorâ€™s awry rule is why Aeteria is in its current state!

Haye
Silence! I will not hear vile from a witch! I owe my life to the Emperor... I owe it to the empire for digging me out from the lowest depths of Ideon. And I will fight for Aeteria 'til my last breath.

Chiffon
I wanted to defeat you, Major. But even I realize this is fruitless! Itâ€™s completely pointless to battle here when the Emperor and the Apostle have been leading Aeteria to its downfall.

Haye
.......

Chiffon
Youâ€™re at the verge of death. Stop. Lay down your arms now.

Haye
..........

Chiffon
Leave. So many lives have been lost to this war, yes... But Aeteria needs to heal... And it can. I believe in the empire and its people. Aeteria needs a new dawn, and thatâ€™s what we look towards. I think even you can be a part of it.

Haye
.................(unsheath spear sound)

Chiffon
Major...? Lay down your spear...

Haye
......
I understand... This needs to come to an end.

Chiffon
Stop!

Haye
When His Highness bestowed my title... I told him that I would never be looked down upon again... Mercenary... This fight is over...!
(screen flashes)
(he DIES ðŸ¤¯)

Chiffon
.........Major...

Graham
The fool remains a fool to the end. I have never seen a man so mulish.

Raya
Leaderâ€”Chiffon. Whatâ€™s the matter? Donâ€™t tell me youâ€™re sentimental over finally getting your revenge.

Chiffon
I thought I would be the one to die here. To think I can beat the Viper himself...

Graham
In such a short time, you have grown substantially as both a fighter and a leader, Ser. Aeteriaâ€™s new dawn grows ever brighter.

Haye
Are you ready? You must be confident, letting your allies leave the battlegrounds.

Chiffon
This will be your last fight[,] Major. Come at me!

Haye
...Then let us begin. I am General Major Haye of Aeteria. And today... I will add another notch to Xiuhcoatl or fall.

(I have to win this. If not for me, then for Aeteria.)

## ChCh2-7xEnding1
Haye
I... I concede. Youâ€™ve earned it, mercenary. Do not hesitate... Take my life.

Chiffon
Iâ€™m sorry it has to end like this, Major. I... lament your fate.

Haye
.......Heh. Thereâ€™s nothing more to say. Kill me and be done with it. All youâ€™re doing is buying time... for my allies to move in... Theyâ€™ll crush this unjust rebellion... The empire..... will bring a new dawn to Aeteria...
