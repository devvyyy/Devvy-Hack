Their defenses are heavily fortified[,] led by[N]

backed by each of the Imperial generals.[AN]

[FL]
We've gained the attention of a Consul?[.6][N]
Now we've really done it[Beat] If we can take down[N]
one of the Trinity like that[,] the empire[Beat][AN]
This new Aeteria might be closer than we[N]

I'm ready.[AN]

Very good.[.6] If we can overtake and defeat[N]
one so grand in battle[Beat][AN]

[FR]
Graham.[.6] We[Beat] We can.[.6] We've been unstoppable[N]
thus far.[.6] As a team we fought tooth and nail[N]
to get where we are.[AN]
Major Hayes no longer stands in our way.[.6][N]
Today[Beat] We've declared total war against[N]
the empire.[AN]

[FL]
We're a little late on that[,] leader.[.6][N]
But everybody's fired up.[.6] On your signal[,][N]
we'll engage the enemy.[AN]

[R]
Yes[Beat] And we will continue to do so.[.6][N]
This is certain to be a stained and[N]
bloody battle.[AN]
But[Beat] One's eminence is determined through[N]
sacrifice.[.6] We will stake a claim to a[N]
new[,] True Aeteria.[AN][CSS]

A fool[,] he was[Beat] but even I cannot[N]

I may not have always agreed with the[N]

what he thought was best for Aeteria.[AN]

Forgive me[,] Messel.[.6] I had to make myself a[N]
nice cup of joe for the upcoming battle.[.6][N]
Night has fallen[,] after all.[AN]

[FFR][MoveFarRight]
Well[,] drink up quick.[.6] The Liberators are[N]
upon us.[.6] They intend to cross the[N]

Well[,] well[,] well.[.6] So that bunch is who[N]
they call Liberators![.6] What a small band![.6][N]
Hardly anything I'm not used to.[AN]
Honestly[,] the bridge is kinda nostalgic.[6N]
But it is a pleasure to finally meet them[N]

Consul Aoife.[.6] The rebel forces have gained too[N]
much ground in such little time.[.6] Do you see the[N]

That one in particular will prove to be a[N]
problem.[.6] She carries herself like a demon[N]
on the battlefield.[AN]

[ML]
Oh?[.6] Is she[,] now? We'll see.[AN]

[FFR][MoveFarRight]
The people rally behind Ser Chiffon as more[N]
than just a simple leader.[.6] She's[Beat] an idea--[.4][N]
a spark of sorts.[AN]
Weak flames die with the wind[,] but such parks[N]
do not die.[.6] They await to be reignited.[6N]
We have to extinguish their light.[AN]

[FFR][MoveRight]
Might I have a quick moment[,] Consul?[AN]

[ML]
Who am I to deny you[,] Wellington?[6N]
Be easy on me[,] though.[.6] Arriving on short[N]
notice is one of my blind spots.[AN]

[R]
The rebel forces have gained too[N]
much ground.[.6] And you underestimate the[N]
mercenary and her allies.[AN]
Those of the Order and Resistance fight[N]
with her.[.6] I knew ex-court Graham was[N]
a snake[Beat] but Yufka[,] too?![AN]
They have spawned endless chaos in our[N]
prisons and cities[,] Consul.[.6][N]
Our forces have been decimated![AN]

[ML]
Yes[,] I'm very impressed with the liberation's[N]
resume.[.6] But many can stand armed[N]
against the empire.[.6] Many more fall.[AN]
I've heard and seen the same things across[N]
my life[,] time and time again.[6N]
On this very bridge[,] even.[AN]

[FR][CF][Opal]
Your orders[,] Consul?[.6] The time has come for[N]
us to make our first move.[AN]

[ML]
Right[,] my apologies[,] Mala.[.6] I do tend to babble[,][N]
but if you want to continue our little chat[N]
after the battle[,] I would very much be open.[AN]
You all[,] move into position at once.[.6][N]

The heir lost to time[Beat] truly does[N]

Hm?[.6] What brought this on?[AN]

[ML][MML]
Don't play dumb![.6] This is all what[N]
you wanted[,] wasn't it? You knew[Beat][N]
You knew this would happen![AN]
You knew the true extent of those[Beat][N]
savage powers within her[Beat] Honing her[N]

And you wanted to leverage them for[N]
your own gain[,] didn't you?![6N]
That's why you hesitate even now![AN]

[MR]
To be clear[,] I am not hesitating.[AN]

[ML]
Malcolm[Beat] When you found her[Beat][N]
you must've already known that she was[N]
some[Beat] Imperial lunatic![AN][Event]

[MR]
Ideonian legend tells of an unshackled heir[N]
who will rise upon the moonlit night to[N]
deliver true justice.[AN]
Ser Chiffon[Beat] No[,] Princess Sylmeria is[N]
our savior.[.6] She is the hero who will[N]
liberate this country.[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]It all makes sense now.[.6] How you[N]
were always whispering in her ear.[6N]
You wanted to sink your fangs into her.[AN]
For her to be your twisted little puppet[N]
on the stage of the Imperial court.[6N]
What is wrong with you?![AN]

[MR]
She will be inaugurated.[.6] She will slay[N]
Emperor Selwyn and reclaim Aeteria[,][N]
reshaping it in her vision.[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]So you mean to tell me that you're[N]
hurling her into the Imperial court on her[N]
own[,] with no form of support at all?[AN]
You're going to bet our people's future[N]
on whether one girl sinks or swims?[6N][MML]
Do you even hear yourself?![AN]
I put my trust in you and your band of[N]

[ML]
Believe in her?[.6] I[Beat] I wanted to believe[N]
in the woman who fought beside us[,][N]
even if we didn't see eye to eye.[AN][C]
But in the end[,] she was just some[N]
puppet for your prophecies[,] right?![AN]

[MR]
No[,] Raial.[.6] I believe you never got[N]
over your mistrust of our leader.[6N]
You underestimate her even now.[AN]
The truth was always inside her[,][N]
waiting to awaken.[.6] She is one of[N]
Imperial blood.[AN]

[ML]
Waiting to awaken?![.6] Do you even hear[N]
yourself[,] Graham?![.6] You saw what[N]
happened just as clearly as I did![AN]
She lost control of her powers[,][N]
just as I'd always feared[Beat][N]
She slaughtered without hesitation![AN]

[MR]
And yet she lives.[.6] The Consul did not kill[N]
her.[.6] Why do you think that is?[AN]

[ML]
Because she needs her alive![.6] She's the[N]
key to their rule![AN]

[MR]
And would that be so terrible?[.6] She is[N]
meant to lead;[.4] this is simply the[N]
path Fate has laid before us.[AN]

[ML][MML]
Fate?![.6] Don't you dare talk to me[N]
about fate![.6] We bled for this rebellion[,][N]
and you'd throw it away like that?![AN][C]
Throw her away like a pawn on a board?![AN]

[MR]
I did not throw away anything[,] Raial.[6N]
Our goal was to see Aeteria's new dawn.[6N]
Princess Sylmeria will guide us to that light.[AN]

[ML]
Then tell me this--[.4]when Chiffon awakes in[N]
the enemy's hands[,] and sees what she's[N]
done,[.4] what will she choose?[AN][C]
Will she even have a choice as a[N]
heartless killing machine?![AN]

[MR]
What a cruel way to word it.[.6] I meant to[N]
prepare her for her rightful role.[6N]
To teach her what she needs to rule.[AN]
And having seen her in the fray[,] I have[N]
full faith that she will make the right[N]
choice[,] when the time comes.[AN]
She will see the truth.[.6] She will[N]
understand her destiny.[.6] Emperor Selwyn[N]
will die by her hand.[AN]

[ML]
Or she'll break[,] snap under the weight[N]
of it all.[.6] It'll be a massacre[,][N]
just like today.[AN]
And then what do we do[,] Malcolm Graham?![6N]
What the hell will we do then?![6N][MML]
Look[,] I'm not wasting another second.[AN]
I'm going to rescue her with my mercs[,][N]
no matter what bullshit you try to pull.[6N]

did that lead us?[AN]
To a bridge of the fallen?[.6] What tomorrow[N]
does Aeteria even look to?[AN]

[MR]
When I make it happen[,] it'll be one[N]
of unity.[.6] The people of the empire won't[N]
have to shed tears onto the snow.[AN][Event]

[MR]
Will you fight with us[,] General Opali?[AN]

[ML]
Such courage.[.6] Very well.[.6] You may not[N]
have the blade of the other generals[,][N]
but my axe is yours.[AN]
I have stood by long enough watching[N]
Aeteria's people suffer.[.6] Today[Beat] I raise[N]
my axe for them once again![AN]

[MR]
Thank you![.6] May moonlight guide us.[AN]

The golden-eyed mercenary[Beat][N]
They call you Ser Chiffon[,][N]
do they not?[AN][C]
Then I must do what I must.[6N]
I'm sorry[,] child.[AN]

[MR]
Aeteria is not as she should be![6N]
Do you see?![.6] There's something gravely[N]
wrong with the Emperor[Beat][AN]

[ML]
[Pause]How would you know?[AN]

[MR]
Anyone with an eye can see it[,] General.[6N]
The villagers go hungry as rations[N]
begin to deplete.[AN]
Thievery and brigands continue to[N]
roam the bitter lands because they have[N]
no other choice.[AN]
Look at how you were posted to defend[N]
the sack of guts that is Count Locro[Beat][N]
You of all people must see through this![AN]

[ML]
Perhaps I am an old fool[Beat] but I must[N]
act in accordance to my duties as General.[AN]

[MR]
You don't have to[,] General![.6] You can[N]
fight with us![AN]

[ML]
I will never fight for one of you.[6N]
What have you rebels done?[.6] You[N]
couldn't even stop a few robbers.[AN]
Even if I do not fully believe in His[N]
Majesty[,] his vision of Aeteria shines[N]
brighter than your 'rebellion'.[AN]

[ML]
I am truly sorry[,] Ser.[6N]

General Wellington of Aeteria.[6N]
Why do you continue to fight?[6N]
This war is pointless![AN]

[ML]
Of course I know that.[.6] I've seen[N]
the people sick and weary[,] while the[N]
nobles continue to press the kingdom.[AN]

[MR]
The Empire is rotting under Emperor Selwyn's[N]
rule.[.6] You saw it yourself[,] General.[6N]
You must've trained those recruits[,] right?[AN][C]
You knew they were nothing but pawns[N]
to the Emperor.[AN]

[ML]
Yes[Beat] What do you intend by bringing[N]
that up[,] O leader of the rebellion?[AN]

[MR]
I want you to fight with us.[6N]
We can minimize casualties[,] and bring[N]
down the Emperor's grasp on Aeteria![AN]

[ML]
Such a naive[,] entitled mindset[Beat][N]
But it's certainly a breath of fresh air[N]
after everything that's happened.[AN][C][Event]
Very well[,] what exactly do you intend[N]
to do with me at your side?[AN]

[MR]
We're crossing over[,] and we're gonna[N]
help the people of the kingdom and get[N]
them on our side.[AN]
I'm not quite sure what happens next[,][N]
but I know it involves the Emperor's head[N]
on a silver platter.[AN]

[ML]
I'm not sure how we're going from singing[N]
songs and holding hands with royal soldiers[N]
to that endpoint.[AN]
But it's a better plan than whatever's[N]
going on with Selwyn[,] so you have[N]
my sword[,] Ser.[AN]

[MR]
Thank you[,] General.[.6] You won't[N]
regret your choice![AN]

[ML]
I must be clear[,] however[Beat][N]
If you betray such a fickle trust[Beat][N]
I will be the first to strike you down.[AN]

You won't even have to worry about it.[6N]
That's not gonna happen.[AN]

You really think you can talk me[N]

General[Beat] We don't have to do this.[AN]

[ML]
The hell we don't![.6] I saw those recruits--[.4][N]
the ones you shot down without[N]
one bit of hesitation.[AN]
You're no hero[,] Ser Chiffon.[.6] You're[N]
just another warlord who thinks she's[N]
at odds with the last one.[AN]

[MR]
They were tools to be used and[N]
discarded by Emperor Selwyn.[AN]

Discarded by you.[.6] You played right into[N]

You answer to such a wicked man?[6N]

Well[Beat] I'd be betraying Aeteria if I stayed.[6N]
You're right[,] lass.[.6] The Emperor doesn't[N]

And you're so[Beat] earnest.[.6] I can see it[N]
in your eyes.[.6] Ah[,] damn it all.[6N]
I'll fight with your army[,] Ser.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]And you're not joking?[AN]

[ML]
One of my messengers came up to me.[AN]
She said that you spared all of them[,][N]
