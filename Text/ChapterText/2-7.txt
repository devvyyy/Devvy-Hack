Jaye
Everything alright, Chiff?[.6] The march is about to begin.

Chiffon
I'm alright.[.6] It's just[Beat] everything feels so distant.[.6] We're closer than ever to Wreyvine, yes, but[Beat] What happens after this?[.6] We elude the lancepoint of Major Haye[Beat]..[.6] and we fall into the jaws of kingdom soldiers?

Jaye
That won't happen.

Chiffon
What makes you so sure?

Jaye
We[Beat] We can't go back now, leader.[.6] Either way, the most we can do here is continue fighting.[.6] We either get through or we go down with spells blazing!

Chiffon
But[Beat]

Raya
Are you seriously doubting yourself now?[.6] After everything we've been through?[.6] We're too far in for this, leader.[.6] You led us to victory time and time again.[.6] There's absolutely no reason for doubt now.

Graham
The night sets to the north, Ser.[.6] This is an ample time if any to make our final march towards Wreyvine.[.6] Bordering the bridge is an abandoned kingdom fortress we will take refuge in.[.6] I agree with the Captain's sentiment, but these are unprecedented.[.6] Major Haye and his forces are surrounding the premises.[.6] We don't have any time left--[.4]pack up your stuff and get ready.[.6] We prevail over his forces and cross over to the kingdom or we die.

Chiffon
I understand[Beat] Alert the others.[.6] We'll march at once.

## Ch2-7Opening2
[3L]
Chiffon
We're already surrounded[Beat] We have to fall back and form up, now!

Raya
How long have they been out here to prepare?

Graham
As expected.[.6] Our next moves will be decisive--[.4]your orders, leader?

(Haye is at the other side of the bridge)

Haye
Rebels![.6] I offer you a chance to surrender.[.6] Lay down your arms[Beat] and I shall lower mine.[.6] You have disturbed the peace of this holy empire[Beat] disrupted the order and desecrated the Imperial holy accord[Beat] But stand down, and you will not lose your lives!

## Ch2-7Opening3
[3L]
Chiffon
Never look back.

Raya
We won't let some imperial lapdog take our lives and our home away from us.[.6] There's always a way to prevail.

Graham
Surrender was never an option.[.6] Leader, has your honing of your latent powers not been for this?[.6] Send a message to the empire.[.6] Extirpate the imperial forces.[.6] Do not let a single one escape!

Chiffon
Of course, Reverend.[.6] This is the only way.

Haye
We cannot let them through.[.6] No matter the cost.

Soldier Gal ðŸ˜±
Major Haye[Beat]?

Haye
Stay clear of the Serpent's mark on the floor[Beat] They are not just a smirch on hallowed ground.[.6] It is laid with oil.

Soldier
You aren't suggesting to--[.4]

Haye
No matter the cost--[.4]we will raze the border until naught but cinders remain if we have to!

Haye
They're here at last![.6] Come, rebels![.6] See your rebellion trampled underfoot by the flames of a new Aeteria!
(he steps forward, eventing shit happens; turn on firey weather, fire map palette, etc.)

Haye
It was Messel's error that keeps you alive now, witch.[.6] I overlooked it then, but here, I shall rectify such a grave mistake.[.6] To think some pest would sprout into leading the very thing destroying Aeteria[Beat]

Chiffon
Why do you continue?[.6] The Emperor's awry rule is why Aeteria is in its current state!

Haye
Silence![.6] I will not hear vile from a witch![.6] I owe my life to the Emperor[Beat] I owe it to the empire for digging me out from the lowest depths of Ideon.[.6] And I will fight for Aeteria 'til my last breath.

Chiffon
I wanted to defeat you, Major.[.6] But even I realize this is fruitless![.6] It's completely pointless to battle here when the Emperor and the Apostle have been leading Aeteria to its downfall.

Haye
[Beat][Beat].

Chiffon
You're at the verge of death.[.6] Stop.[.6] Lay down your arms now.

Haye
[Beat][Beat][Beat].

Chiffon
Leave.[.6] So many lives have been lost to this war, yes[Beat] But Aeteria needs to heal[Beat] And it can.[.6] I believe in the empire and its people.[.6] Aeteria needs a new dawn, and that's what we look towards.[.6] I think even you can be a part of it.

Haye
[Beat][Beat][Beat][Beat][Beat]..(unsheath spear sound)

Chiffon
Major[Beat]?[.6] Lay down your spear[Beat]

Haye
[Beat][Beat]
I understand[Beat] This needs to come to an end.

Chiffon
Stop!

Haye
When His Highness bestowed my title[Beat] I told him that I would never be looked down upon again[Beat] Mercenary[Beat] This fight is over[Beat]!
(screen flashes)
(he DIES ðŸ¤¯)

Chiffon
[Beat][Beat][Beat]Major[Beat]

Graham
The fool remains a fool to the end.[.6] I have never seen a man so mulish.

Raya
Leader--[.4]Chiffon.[.6] What's the matter?[.6] Don't tell me you're sentimental over finally getting your revenge.

Chiffon
I thought I would be the one to die here.[.6] To think I can beat the Viper himself[Beat]

Graham
In such a short time, you have grown substantially as both a fighter and a leader, Ser.[.6] Aeteria's new dawn grows ever brighter.

Haye
Are you ready?[.6] You must be confident, letting your allies leave the battlegrounds.

Chiffon
This will be your last fight[,] Major.[.6] Come at me!

Haye
[Beat]Then let us begin.[.6] I am General Major Haye of Aeteria.[.6] And today[Beat] I will add another notch to Xiuhcoatl or fall.

Haye
I[Beat] I concede.[.6] You've earned it, mercenary.[.6] Do not hesitate[Beat] Take my life.

Chiffon
I'm sorry it has to end like this, Major.[.6] I[Beat] lament your fate.

Haye
[Beat][Beat].Heh.[.6] There's nothing more to say.[.6] Kill me and be done with it.[.6] All you're doing is buying time[Beat] for my allies to move in[Beat] They'll crush this unjust rebellion[Beat] The empire[Beat]..[.6] will bring a new dawn to Aeteria[Beat]

Chiffon
