Everything alright[,] Chiff?[.6] The march is[N]
about to begin.[AN]

[MR]
I'm alright.[.6] It's just[Beat] everything feels[N]
so distant.[.6] We're closer than ever to[N]
Wreyvine[,] yes[,] but[Beat][AN]
What happens after this?[.6] We elude the[N]
lancepoint of Major Hayes[Beat] and we fall into[N]
the jaws of kingdom soldiers?[AN][CSS]

[ML][MoveFarLeft]
[L][Verna]
That won't happen[,] Ser.[AN]

[MR]
Lady Verna[Beat] What makes you so sure?[AN]

[L]
We are strong.[.6] Even when faced with[N]
the Imperial Generals[,] we never faltered.[6N]
This is just more of the same.[AN]

[FL]
We[Beat] We can't go back now[,] leader.[.6][N]
Either way[,] the most we can do here is[N]
continue fighting.[AN]
We either get through or we go down[N]
with spells blazing![.6] And I dunno 'bout[N]
you[,] but we're getting through![AN]

[MR]
Even so[Beat][AN]

[FFL]
Are you seriously doubting yourself now?[AN][Event]

[L][CF][Raya]
Come on[,] what's with the grim face?[6N]
After everything we've been through?[.6][N]
We're too far in for this[,] leader.[AN]
You've led us to victory time and time again.[.6][N]
The princess was right.[.6] We're strong.[6N]
There's absolutely no reason for doubt now.[6N]
You have a good head on your shoulders.[AN]

[MR]
I guess so[,] Raial.[.6] I suppose our task ahead[N]
is clear.[.6] Crush Major Hayes[,] cross over[,][N]
and take back Aeteria.[AN]

[L]
You get it[,] lass.[.6] And don't say[N]
[OpenQuote]I guess so"![.6] You *know* that we're[N]
gonna win this damn war![AN]

[FL][CF][Graham]
The night sets to the north[,] Ser.[.6][N]
This is an ample time if any to make our[N]
final march towards Wreyvine.[AN]

[MR]
Perfect timing as always[,] huh?[.6][N]
Then we won't miss a single beat.[AN]

[FL]
Bordering the bridge is an abandoned kingdom[n]
fortress we will take refuge in.[.6][n]
I agree with the Captain's sentiment,[AN]
but these are unprecedented times.[AN][C]
Major Hayes and his forces are surrounding[N]
the premises.[.6] We have limited time[,] if any.[AN]
But the night is still:[.4] we will prevail over[N]
his forces and cross over before long.[6N]
That was your pledge[,] was it not?[AN]

[MR]

You have disturbed the peace of the holy[N]

the Imperial holy accord[Beat][AN]
But stand down now[,] and you will not lose[N]
your lives![.6] I offer you all a fair trial![6N]

Not on my watch.[.6] Nobody is going[N]

What is this folly[,] Ser Chiffon?[.6][N]
Your hesitation is quite unlike you.[6N]
Major Hayes is in our way.[AN]
He crushed you in a humiliating defeat.[6N]
Now is your narrow opportunity to settle[N]
the score and feed him to the wolves![AN]

[ML]
I know I can do this[,] Reverend.[AN]

Surrender was never an option.[.6] Leader[,] has[N]
your honing of your latent powers not[N]
been for this?[.6] Vengeance?[AN]
Send a message to the empire.[.6][N]
Extirpate the imperial forces.[.6][N]
Do not let a single one escape![AN]

There is no [OpenQuote]but" here[,] Raial.[6N]
We will cull every single one of them.[6N]

Of course[,] Reverend.[.6] This is the only way.[6N]
