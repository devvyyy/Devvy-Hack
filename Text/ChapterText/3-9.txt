[FL][Affogato][L][Chiffon][MR][Selwyn2]

[MR]
You all managed to climb all the way here.[6N]
I commend your persistence more than[N]
your bravery.[.6] Welcome to the show.[AN]

[L]
We came to end this[,] Selwyn!.[6N]
You and the Consuls should ready[N]
your forces.[AN]

[MR]
So eager to cut me down.[.6] Control yourself[,][N]
sister.[.6] I see your bowhands hesitate.[6N]
Are you still afraid?[AN]

[L]
It's not hesitation now.[6N]
I can't wait to end this.[AN]

[MR]
That was the same savagery that lead[N]
to the massacre at the bridge[,][N]
was it not?[AN]
If you do not learn restraint[,] [OpenQuote]little light"[,][N]
you may find yourself a monster[N]
of your own creation.[AN]

[FL]
[Beat][AN]

[MR]
And you fight with him.[.6] The hooded man[,] the[N]
failed assassin[,] and[Beat] the man who cut[N]
down our mother.[AN]

[FL]
[Beat][AN]

[L][MoveLeft]
Huh?![.6] Apsiel[Beat]?[AN]

[MR]
I know the hand that pierced my[N]
mother's heart[,] Apsiel Emrys of Aeteria's[N]
24th division.[AN][CSS]

[FL][MoveLeft]
You sound so certain[,] Emperor.[6N]
I suppose you've had time to connect[N]
the dots.[AN]

[MR]
Seven months to review every misstep of[N]
that night.[.6] Every noise out of place.[6N]
Every corridor possibly shadowed.[AN]
A sable dirk tied with a blue ribbon[,][N]
corrupted by the touch of the Harbinger.[6N]
It can only be you.[AN]

[L]
Her Excellency put up a fight.[6N]
The Harbinger's power faded[,] and I[N]
lost my memories.[AN]

[MR]
What is this false flattery[,] Apsiel?[6N]
You speak of power as though it were a[N]
wound to be staunched.[AN]
You were one of us.[.6] And you died.[6N]
Was this some[Beat] twisted act of[N]
vengeance?[.6] Or treason?[AN]

[L]
The Harbinger took me.[.6] I went back to[N]
the empire as a returned spy.[.6] You[N]
know how this story ends.[AN]

[MR]
I do.[.6] Of course.[.6] None of you will[N]
survive as Ideon freezes into naught[N]
but snow and ice.[AN]
Our mother's death was the spark that[N]
lit the fires of war.[.6] Apsiel[,] you set[N]
this whole war in motion with that blade.[AN]
The blade that struck the empire[N]
stands before me as your champion?[6N]
What a tragic folly.[AN][CSS]

[FL][CF][Raial]
He killed your mom[,] kid.[.6] What're[N]
you gonna do about it?[.6] Cry?[AN][CSS]

[L][CF][Graham]
We did not climb these walls to feed[N]
you closure.[.6] We climbed them to[N]
end your reign.[AN][CSS]

[FL][CF][L][CF][FL][Affogato][L][Ulrich]
[L]
You underestimate what we've become[,][N]
Emperor.[.6] We fight for every life[N]
you've tried to snuff out![AN]

[MR]
Lives?[.6] I speak of destiny[,] false Lieutenant.[6N]
A beautiful future[,] a woven[,] united Aeteria.[AN]

[L]
This isn't about destiny.[.6] It's about choice.[6N]
And your choice to start a war over[N]
Zoria's death lead us here.[AN][CSS]

[FL][MoveLeft]
You've forced us into this[,] Selwyn.[AN]

[MR]
Enough.[.6] There is nothing left to say.[6N]
There is no choice but to die by[N]
my hand as Ideon rises.[AN]
For this world[,] nothing will stop me.[6N]
You hesitated once already[,] Apsiel.[6N]
I hope you do not do so again.[AN]

[L]
I won't.[AN]

[MR][Selwyn2]
No[Beat] Was it all for naught[Beat]?![6N]
All this carnage[,] this raging storm[Beat][N]
This blessing[Beat] How did you[Beat][AN]

[L]
It's over[,] Emperor[Beat][N]
Stand down.[AN]

[MR]
Ah[Beat] the shadow of the crown steps forward.[.6][N]
Will you be the one to finish the job[N]
you failed seven months ago?[AN]

[L]
I didn't understand what I was then or[N]
what I was made to do.[.6] But I understand[N]
now[Beat] I wasn't built to serve.[AN]

[MR]
No[Beat] You weren't.[.6] How fitting that the[N]
ghost who haunts my dreams would come[N]
back for me[Beat][AN]

[FL]
Seven months ago[Beat] Everything was normal.[6N]
Trade flowed[,] the banners were flown high.[6N]
Northelm was bustling.[AN]
The frost hadn't touched the rivers.[6N]
People fished and forged away.[6N]
You took that away from the kingdom.[AN]
You killed Anatolius.[.6] You started a war that[N]
scorched Wreyvine and Aeteria amidst[N]
harsh[,] dead cold.[AN] 

[MR]
The King was a weak man[,] you impostor.[6N]
I know you as well[,] Otto.[.6] You think[N]
a treacherous dog has the right to speak?![AN]

[FL]
Your reign ended here[,] Emperor Selwyn.[6N]
I do not bow to fallen lords.[AN]

[MR]
Yet you avenge Anatolius[Beat] You're a fool[Beat][AN]
[CSS]

[FL][CF][Gorlois]
The King would not have wanted this.[6N]
All he wanted was an eternal kingdom.[6N]
One made up of peace.[AN]

[MR]
Peace is an illusion[,] Gorlois.[6N]
You all have sinned.[.6] You all carved the[N]
hole that my ambition stepped through.[AN]
Do you remember that day[,] Apsiel?[6N]
I said you looked pale underneath the[N]
helmet[Beat] That I lacked proper manners.[AN]
If you'd killed me like you were ordered[N]
to[Beat] This war might never have happened.[6N]
Ideon would balance in power.[AN]

[L]
That's true.[.6] I lit the fuse that sparked[N]
this war[Beat] But you were the one who[N]
refused to douse it.[AN]
[CSS]

[FL][CF][Chiffon][MoveLeft]
Are you done?[AN]

[MR]
I[Beat] never expected to fall by you[Beat][N]
Yet here I lie[,] undone by the invisible[N]
hands that[Beat] guided my fate.[AN]

[L]
I never knew you[,] brother[,] but all I[N]
feel is pity now.[AN]

[MR]
So clear-eyed[,] sister.[.6] What lunacy.[6N]
I do not want your pity.[.6] Such sentiments[N]
are worthless.[AN]
[CSS]

[FL][CF][Graham]
You have provoked much disorder and imbalance[N]
in your pursuit of vengeance[Beat][N]
Death is a mercy for you[,] Selwyn.[AN]

[MR]
Haha[Beat] Even now[,] you insist on lecturing me.[6N]
You haven't changed a bit[,] Graham.[6N]
I see you[Beat] and your Order.[AN]

[FL]
[Beat][AN]
[CSS][CF][Affogato]

[L]
Emperor[Beat] Even so[,] I[Beat] I'm sorry.[AN]

[MR]
Dying at the hands of a traitorous corpse and[N]
a bastard heir[Beat] Hahaha![.6] This is perfect.[AN]

[L]
You're not the one causing this cold[,][N]
are you?[AN]

[MR]
Syl[Beat] Her caring heart seeps.[.6] Her heart[N]
is beginning to petrify[Beat] All of this[N]
bitterness is by her silence.[AN]

[FL]
We know.[.6] She's the last.[AN]

[MR]
Then I suppose I should thank you brutes.[6N]
You've spared me from the endless cold[N]
waiting above.[AN]
She doesn't feel the same way we do.[6N]
Her grief is pure ether manifest.[6N]
You'll see[Beat] You'll[Beat] see[Beat][AN][CloseEyes]

[FL]
[Pause]It's done.[AN]

[.6]
[MR][CF]

[R][Raial]
Selwyn is dead[Beat] The empire falls with him![AN]

[L]
No[,] not yet[,] Captain[Beat] We can't afford to[N]
rest on our laurels[,] even with Selwyn out.[AN]

[FR][Ulrich]
The Apostle[Beat] She's behind all this[,] isn't she?[6N]
If we kill her[,] this insanity should stop![AN]

[L]
Yes[Beat] We'll be able to breathe once this is[N]
all over--[.4]once Apostle Sylveria falls by[N]
our hand[Beat][AN]

[MR][Sylveria2]

[MR]
Sister[Beat] You returned at last[Beat][N]
I was alone[Beat] I feared the darkness had[N]
claimed you again.[AN]

[ML]
Sylveria[,] stop this.[AN]

[MR]
Do you see?[.6] The world is still[Beat][N]
The wind that chills these halls as[N]
the aurora wavers outside.[AN]
Everyone is gone[,] sister.[.6] Mother[Beat][N]
Antonius[Beat] Even Sel is gone now.[6N]
And by Cruel Fate[Beat] You'll be next.[AN]

[ML]
Your grief cursed this world[,] Syl.[6N]
We can end this together![AN]

[MR]
End it?[.6] I've[Beat] tried.[.6] I cannot die.[.6][N]
My heart[Beat] it froze with every piercing loss.[6N]
I can hardly hear them now.[AN]
Mother's laughter[,] Sel's defiance[,][N]
Antonius' songs[Beat] They're all gone[,][N]
unable to return even with my power.[AN]
There's no turning back from my sins[,][N]
sister.[.6] I've warped winter into a[N]
prison upon these lands.[AN]

[CSS]
[ML][MoveLeft]
You think you failed them?[.6][N]
But you loved them fiercely[,] Sylveria.[6N]
It doesn't have to end this way.[AN]
That love still lives in you[,] ethereal[N]
or not.[.6] It can thaw your heart.[6N]
I know this to be true![AN]

[ML]
I cannot kill you[,] sister.[6N]
My heart would shatter if I did.[6N]
But I also cannot let you pass[Beat][AN]
If I fell[,] everything I created through ether--[4N]
the frost consuming the castle[,] the[N]
wraiths[Beat] This frozen world[Beat][AN]
It would die.[AN]

[FL][Ulrich]
That means[Beat] Affogato[Beat][AN]

[L][CF][Affogato]
I've been ready for this since the[N]
war started[,] Lieutenant.[6N]
Now and always.[AN]
Since I found my way to your platoon[,][N]
since I fought by the kingdom's side as a[N]
scout[,] and as long as I draw breath.[AN]
Apostle Sylveria[,] I carry no hatred for you.[6N]
It was through your work as a reaper[N]
that gave me a second life.[AN]

[MR]
What[Beat]?[AN]

[L]
As with Lady Vida[,] I'm a construct you[N]
created[,] Apostle.[.6] I fell like[N]
an ordinary soldier.[AN]
I never understood why I could walk[N]
when my heart had stopped.[.6] That heart[N]
remains still even now.[AN]
A dark grasp clutched at my soul[,][N]
and I rose[Beat] Because the Harbinger was[N]
always within[,] waiting to awaken.[AN]
I[,] a dead man[,] walked.[.6] I saw you at the[N]
palace courtyard[,] playing piano.[6N]
[Pause]You were honing your powers.[AN]

[MR]
You[Beat] were never meant to survive.[6N]

[L]
I was slain[,] resurrected[,] and reconstructed.[6N]
There's only one way this can end.[6N]

[MR]
I[Beat] No[Beat][AN]

[FL]
Enough![.6] This thicket of ice was your doing.[6N]
Thousands died because of this winter[N]
and this god-damned war![AN][CSS][CF]

[L][CF][Chiffon][MoveLeft]
Sylveria[,] stop![AN]

[MR]
I wanted nothing more than to live.[6N]
To live alongside you[,] sister.[.6] But our[N]
lives are bound to destruction.[AN]
Our paths can never cross.[.6] May the[N]
Serpent's vision and guiding light bless[N]
our souls[Beat][AN]
Please[Beat] Face me.[.6] I can feel my heart[Beat][N]
I feel number[,] colder with each moment.[6N]
You must.[AN]

[L]
I'll free you and thaw this world[,][N]
no holds barred.[.6] Ideon must see a[N]
bright[,] warm dawn.[AN]
This must end[,] here and now[,] sister.[6N]
I'm going to end this eternal winter[,][N]
once and for all![AN]

[MR]
Then do it[,] army of Ideon.[.6] Do what I cannot.[6N]
Let the spring follow my fall[N]
in one last song.[AN]

[L]
I'm[Beat] sorry it had to be like this.[AN]

[MR]
I'm sorry[,] too[,] sister[Beat][AN]
