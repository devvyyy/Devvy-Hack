[MR]
You all managed to climb all the way here.[6N]
I commend your persistence more than[N]
your bravery.[.6] Welcome to the show.[AN]

[L]
We came to end this now[,] Selwyn![6N]
You and the Consuls should ready[N]
your forces.[AN]

[MR]
So eager to cut me down.[.6] Control yourself[,][N]
sister.[.6] I see your bowhands hesitate.[6N]
Are you still afraid?[AN]

[L]
It's not hesitation now.[6N]
I can't wait to end this.[AN]

[MR]
That was the same savagery that lead[N]
to the massacre at the bridge[,][N]
was it not?[AN]
If you do not learn restraint[,] [OpenQuote]little light"[,][N]
you may find yourself a monster[N]
of your own creation.[AN]

[FL]
[Beat][AN]

[L]
Enough[,] brother.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]I see.[.6] So Syl was influenced by you.[AN]
You cannot resist meddling in affairs[N]
beyond your station.[AN]

[L]
I am the rightful heir to this throne.[6N]
Stand down or die[,] Selwyn.[AN]

[MR]
Is that so[,] dear sister?[6N]
You[,] who knows nothing of statecraft and[N]
the empire[,] are the rightful heir?[AN]
You[,] who never met the Empress.[6N]
She was murdered by someone you[N]
stand side-by-side with[,] even now.[AN]

[FL]
[Beat][AN]

[MR]
And you fight with him.[.6] The hooded man[,] the[N]
failed assassin[,] and[Beat] the man who cut[N]
down our mother.[AN]

[L][MoveLeft]
Huh?![.6] Apsiel[Beat]?[AN]

[MR]
I know the hand that pierced my[N]
mother's heart[Beat] Apsiel Emrys of Aeteria's[N]
24th division.[AN][CSS]

[FL][MoveLeft]
You sound so certain[,] Emperor.[6N]
I suppose you've had time to connect[N]
the dots.[AN]

[MR]
Seven months to review every misstep of[N]
that night.[.6] Every noise out of place.[6N]
And every corridor possibly shadowed[Beat][AN]
A sable dirk tied with a blue thread[,][N]
corrupted by the touch of the Harbinger.[6N]
It can only be you.[AN]

[L]
Her Excellency put up a fight.[6N]
The Primordial One's power faded[,] and it[N]
took away my memories.[AN]

[MR]
What is this false flattery[,] Apsiel?[6N]
You speak of power as though it were a[N]
wound to be staunched.[AN]
You were one of us.[.6] And you died.[6N]
Was this some[Beat] twisted act of[N]
vengeance?[.6] Or treason?[AN]

[L]
The Primordial One took me.[.6] I went back to[N]
the empire as a returned spy.[.6] You[N]
know how this story ends.[AN]

[MR]
I do.[.6] Of course.[.6] None of you will[N]
survive as Ideon freezes into naught[N]
but snow and ice.[AN]
Our mother's death was the spark that[N]
lit the fires of war.[.6] Apsiel[,] you set[N]
this whole war in motion with that blade.[AN]
The blade that struck the empire[N]
stands before me as your champion?[6N]
What a tragic folly.[AN][CSS]

[FL][CF][Raial]
He killed your mom[,] kid.[.6] What're[N]
you gonna do about it?[.6] Cry?[AN][CSS]

We did not climb these walls to feed[N]
you closure.[.6] We climbed them to[N]
end your reign.[AN][CSS]

Emperor.[.6] We fight for every life[N]
you've tried to snuff out![AN]

[MR]
Lives?[.6] I speak of destiny[,] false Lieutenant.[6N]
A beautiful future[,] a woven[,] united Aeteria.[AN]

[L]
This isn't about destiny.[.6] It's about choice.[6N]
And your choice to start a war over[N]
Zoria's death lead us here.[AN][CSS]

[FL][MoveLeft]
You've forced us into this[,] Selwyn.[AN]

[MR]
Enough.[.6] There is nothing left to say.[6N]
There is no choice but to die by[N]
my hand as Ideon rises.[AN]
For this world[,] nothing will stop me.[6N]
You hesitated once already[,] Apsiel.[6N]
I hope you do not do so again.[AN]

I won't.[AN]

Dear sister[Beat] But you are not me.[6N]
You are a mockery of this empire.[AN]
You have nothing.[AN]
The Serpent's blood flows stronger in me[N]

echo of what I am.[AN]

brewin' upstairs[Beat] Phew.[AN]
But if my ears ain't playin' tricks on me[,][N]
I do believe you're tucked under the[N]
grand staircase like a lost deer.[AN]

[ML]
Go away.[.6] I do not wish to talk.[AN]

[MR]
Sigh[Beat] Look[,] sweetheart.[.6] I am paid handsomely[N]
to teach you music[,] not hunt you down[N]
in[Beat] carpets.[AN][C]
This part ain't even in the job description[,][N]
y'know.[.6] It's well past my hours.[AN]

[ML]
Uhm[Beat] Then don't do it.[.6][N]
I didn't ask for this.[.6][N]
I didn't mean to--[AN]

[MR]
Nobody *means* to light the banquet table[N]
on fire after firing rays of light.[.6][N]

looked disappointed and he never cared[Beat]
Mother looked at me with drowning eyes![AN][C]
Only Sel smiled at me[Beat][AN]

[MR]
Hmm.[.6] That's 'cause they don't know what[N]
to do with this stuff.[.6] Point is[,] big power's[N]
scary if you screw up with it.[AN]
Your kind o' magic[,] the raw,[.4] emotional,[.4] loud[N]
as a[Beat] I dunno[,] parade drum kind.[6N]
It scares folks when it ain't in rhythm.[AN]

[ML]
It hurt them.[.6] I hurt them.[.6]
I wanted to protect them.[.6] And all I[N]
did was[Beat] break everything.[AN]

[MR]
I had a friend once.[.6] Malc.[.6] Babblin' fool[N]
with an affinity for light just like you.[.6N]
He cried when he set stuff ablaze.[AN]

[ML]
[Beat]Uhm[Beat] Mister Mariya[Beat][N]
Was he[Beat] any good?[AN]

[MR]
Awful.[.6] But one day[,] it kinda clicked.[6N]
Not 'cause he got stronger[,] no.[.6] He just[N]
got quieter inside.[AN]

[ML]
[Beat]You're saying I should play piano instead?[AN]

[MR]
Nah[,] little lady.[.6] I'm sayin': Just play one note.[6N]
Then another.[.6] Then a third.[.6] And before long,[4N]
you'll find the shape of your song.

[ML]
But[Beat] Huh?[.6] That's just[Beat] guessing?[.6] It's[N]
not a method.[.6] How am I supposed to know[N]
which note is actually right?

[MR]
Ahem.[AN][C]
You will.[.6] Choosing wrong is sort of the point.[6N]
That is how you learn the difference[N]
between resonance and dissonance.[AN]
One note is a test[,] two is a pattern,[4N]
and three is a theory.[.6] You are not[N]
searching for a song[,] Your Highness.[AN]
You are gathering strength[,] and attuning[N]
yourself to the arcane.[.6] Then[,] you[N]
must carry a steady[,] strong note.[AN]

[ML]

[MR]
Hold that power in your chest[Beat][N]
Feel the light over your palm[Beat][N]

[ML]

talk like that.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat]Heh.[.6] Yeah[,] I get that a lot.[.6][N]
Malc says the same thing[,] usually right before[N]
he tells me I'm being historically irritating.[AN]

[ML]
How[Beat] do you know so much about magic?[6N]
You're a musician.[.6] A [OQ]no-good" statesman of[N]
the Imperial court[Beat][AN]

some folks like you[,] Your Highness.[6N]
Now c'mon--[.4]get up.[AN][C]

[ML]
You're[Beat] not afraid of me?[AN]

[MR]
Sweetheart[,] I've stared down court treasurers[N]
who thought a balanced budget was a[N]
personal insult.[AN]
I've seen worse than a girl with a little[N]
light in her veins.[.6] Now let's go[,][N]

No[,] you don't.[6N]
Try two notes[,] Sel.[.6] Like thi[Beat] and this.[6N]
That's a third interval.[.6] See?[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]Why do you know this?[AN]

[MR]
Mister Maynard says I have "natural arcane
auditory inclination."[.6] Which I don't[N]
think is real.[AN][C]
I think it just means he thinks[N]
I'm annoying.[AN]

[ML]
Heh[,] no arguments here.[AN]

[ML]
Ugh[,] see?![.6] It snapped at me.[.6][N]
That was[,] like a snarl![AN]

[MR]
That was B[Beat] flat.[.6] Very snarlish[,] I admit.[AN]

[ML]
Gah![.6] This is all so very frustrating.[6N]
Pressing multiple notes?[.6] At the same time?[6N]
And in quick succession[Beat] How?[AN]

[MR]
It *is* just notes[,] Sel.[AN]

[ML]
Just notes[,] she says.[.4] I trained with blade[N]
and book and still that instrument despises me.[AN]

[MR]
Maybe it just likes me better.[AN]

[ML]
Maybe it's the[Beat] natural arcane auditory[N]
inclination thing you have.[.6] Or something.[.6][N]
That's why you're so amazing.[AN]

[MR]
Uh[,] what?[.6] Is that a real thing?[AN]

I'm Emperor now.[.6] I decide what's real.[AN]
Alright[,] let's see[Beat] this one[Beat] and this?[AN]

[MR]
Mm[Beat] not quite.[.6] But you're close![.6][N]
You just made a minor chord.[.6] Sounds sad[N]

[ML]
I am sad and lonely.[.6] This piano hates me.[AN]

[MR]
It doesn't hate you.[6N] It just doesn't know[N]
you yet.[.6] Maybe the keys are lonely too.[AN]

[ML]
Sigh[Beat] Why are you looking at me[N]
like that[,] Syl?[AN]

[MR]
It's cold here[,] Sel.[.6] The keys are[,] too.[6N]
But[Beat] Are you really giving up?[.6][N]
I promise you this piano doesn't hate you.[AN]

supposed to sound.[AN]
