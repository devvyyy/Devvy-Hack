[MR]
You all managed to climb all the way here.[6N]
I commend your persistence more than[N]
your bravery.[.6] Welcome to the show.[AN]

[L]
We came to end this now[,] Selwyn![6N]
You and the Consuls should ready[N]
your forces.[AN]

[MR]
So eager to cut me down.[.6] Control yourself[,][N]
sister.[.6] I see your bowhands hesitate.[6N]
Are you still afraid?[AN]

[L]
It's not hesitation now.[6N]
I can't wait to end this.[AN]

[MR]
That was the same savagery that lead[N]
to the massacre at the bridge[,][N]
was it not?[AN]
If you do not learn restraint[,] [OpenQuote]little light"[,][N]
you may find yourself a monster[N]
of your own creation.[AN]

[FL]
[Beat][AN]

[L]
Enough[,] brother.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]I see.[.6] So Syl was influenced by you.[AN]
You cannot resist meddling in affairs[N]
beyond your station.[AN]

[L]
I am the rightful heir to this throne.[6N]
Stand down or die[,] Selwyn.[AN]

[MR]
Is that so[,] dear sister?[6N]
You[,] who knows nothing of statecraft and[N]
the empire[,] are the rightful heir?[AN]
You[,] who never met the Empress.[6N]
She was murdered by someone you[N]
stand side-by-side with[,] even now.[AN]

[FL]
[Beat][AN]

[MR]
And you fight with him.[.6] The hooded man[,] the[N]
failed assassin[,] and[Beat] the man who cut[N]
down our mother.[AN]

[L][MoveLeft]
Huh?![.6] Apsiel[Beat]?[AN]

[MR]
I know the hand that pierced my[N]
mother's heart[Beat] Apsiel Emrys of Aeteria's[N]
24th division.[AN][CSS]

[FL][MoveLeft]
You sound so certain[,] Emperor.[6N]
I suppose you've had time to connect[N]
the dots.[AN]

[MR]
Seven months to review every misstep of[N]
that night.[.6] Every noise out of place.[6N]
And every corridor possibly shadowed[Beat][AN]
A sable dirk tied with a blue thread[,][N]
corrupted by the touch of the Harbinger.[6N]
It can only be you.[AN]

[L]
Her Excellency put up a fight.[6N]
The Primordial One's power faded[,] and it[N]
took away my memories.[AN]

[MR]
What is this false flattery[,] Apsiel?[6N]
You speak of power as though it were a[N]
wound to be staunched.[AN]
You were one of us.[.6] And you died.[6N]
Was this some[Beat] twisted act of[N]
vengeance?[.6] Or treason?[AN]

[L]
The Primordial One took me.[.6] I went back to[N]
the empire as a returned spy.[.6] You[N]
know how this story ends.[AN]

[MR]
I do.[.6] Of course.[.6] None of you will[N]
survive as Ideon freezes into naught[N]
but snow and ice.[AN]
Our mother's death was the spark that[N]
lit the fires of war.[.6] Apsiel[,] you set[N]
this whole war in motion with that blade.[AN]
The blade that struck the empire[N]
stands before me as your champion?[6N]
What a tragic folly.[AN][CSS]

[FL][CF][Raial]
He killed your mom[,] kid.[.6] What're[N]
you gonna do about it?[.6] Cry?[AN][CSS]

[L][CF][Graham]
We did not climb these walls to feed[N]
you closure.[.6] We climbed them to[N]
end your reign.[AN][CSS]

[FL][CF][L][CF][FL][LoadAffoSwitch][L][Ulrich]
[L]
You underestimate what we've become[,][N]
Emperor.[.6] We fight for every life[N]
you've tried to snuff out![AN]

[MR]
Lives?[.6] I speak of destiny[,] false Lieutenant.[6N]
A beautiful future[,] a woven[,] united Aeteria.[AN]

[L]
This isn't about destiny.[.6] It's about choice.[6N]
And your choice to start a war over[N]
Zoria's death lead us here.[AN][CSS]

[FL][MoveLeft]
You've forced us into this[,] Selwyn.[AN]

[MR]
Enough.[.6] There is nothing left to say.[6N]
There is no choice but to die by[N]
my hand as Ideon rises.[AN]
For this world[,] nothing will stop me.[6N]
You hesitated once already[,] Apsiel.[6N]
I hope you do not do so again.[AN]

[L]
I won't.[AN]

[MR]
I suppose congratulations are in order.[.6][N]
Your resilience is[Beat] admirable.[6N]
[Pause]Admirable[,] yet utterly meaningless.[AN][C]
Do you see?[.6] You are powerless in the face[N]
of true adversity.[.6] The Serpent's power is[N]
absolute.[.6] Now turn tail.[AN]

[L][MoveLeft]
Selwyn[Beat] Your reign ends today![AN]

[MR]
Do you think I have not heard that song[N]
before?[.6] Do you know how many would-be[N]
liberators have spat those same words?[AN]

[L]
You've strangled Ideon for long enough.[.6][N]
If I were you[,] I'd stand down and down.[AN]

[MR]
Dear sister[Beat] But you are not me.[6N]
You are a mockery of this empire.[AN]
You have nothing.[AN]
The Serpent's blood flows stronger in me[N]
than in any Imperial heir.[.6] You are very[N]
much mortal[,] and easily so.[AN]
Even that pale imitation of a princess you[N]
think you are is nothing but a hollow[N]
echo of what I am.[AN]

[FL]
[Beat][AN]

[MR]
The Serpent's gift has fused with my soul.[.6][N]
No blade[,] no arrow[,] no holy prayer of yours[N]
can break me.[AN]
Do you wish to see why?[6N]
Look well.[.6] This is a god reborn.[6N]
Now bow[,] before I shatter you entirely.[AN]

[CSS]
[FL][MoveLeft]
Enough.[AN]

[MR]
Ah[Beat] the shadow of the crown steps forward.[.6][N]
The one who failed.[AN]

[L]
It's over[,] Emperor[Beat][N]
You have no idea what you're[N]
stepping into.[AN]

[MR]
Oho?[.6] Is that so[,] traitor?[.6][N]
Why don't you demonstrate?[AN]

Seven months ago[Beat] Everything was normal.[6N]

Northelm was bustling.[AN]
The frost hadn't touched the rivers.[6N]

You took that away from the kingdom.[AN]
You killed Anatolius.[.6] You started a war that[N]

If you'd killed me like you were ordered[N]
