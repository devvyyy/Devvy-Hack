## Ch9Opening1
# tents or forest town cg (if thats a thing)? and OMG HAVE THEM SURVEY THE AREA FIRST with like the stairs? ? ? ? idk
I still can't believe it[Beat][.6][N]
Weeks,[.4] and we're still wanted.[AN]

We're hidden for now.[.6] This will[N]
not last forever.[AN]

We must prepare to make our[N]
next move.[AN]
If we want to survive,[.4] we'll have[N]
to take down Aeteria's army.[AN]

Yo,[.4] Mr. Steakfries![AN]

[X]

## Ch9Opening2
[Pause]And Cortado said,[.4] [OpenQuote]You need to stop blowin'[N]
things up!", so I said[Beat][AN]

Gah,[.4] Jaye![.6] What did I say about[N]
letting strangers on the boat?[AN]

You're not my dad,[.4] bozo.[.6][N]
Suck it up![AN]

[Pause]Frye.[.6] What about you?[AN]

Don't blame me-[.4] Verna said we[N]
needed more steel among us.[AN]

Look![.6] These villagers are lookin'[N]
for scraps to get into.[AN]
Former soldiers,[.4] woodcutters,[.4][N]
we got 'em all.[AN]
I say we choose one of 'em to[N]
join our ranks.[AN]

## Ch9Ending1
Alright,[.4] I decided who[N]
I want with us.[AN]

It's time for the strategy[N]
meeting,[.4] princess.[AN]
[X]

## Ch9Ending2
If we want to take down[N]
the Trinity,[AN]
we need to start by targetting[N]
Aeteria's lords.[AN]

Ugh,[.4] the lords[Beat] They were[N]
all so annoying.[AN]
[Pause]I can say that now that I'm[N]
technically not princess,[.4] right?[AN]

Please be spiteful responsibly[Beat][.6] And[N]
yes,[.4] you're correct.[.6] To both.[AN]
Mm,[.4] let's see[Beat] Aeteria's nobles[Beat] Wronged[N]
once in the past,[AN]
and they hold the grudge against[N]
their people for eternity.[AN]

Such prevalent lords,[.4] yet so[N]
distant to their people-[AN]
it's as though they bear disdain[N]
for all but their own.[AN]


And the Trinity[Beat] You need to[N]
stop with your sentimentality.[AN]
Aoife,[.4] Maynard,[.4] and Eustace have[N]
always been like this.[AN]
Yes,[.4] the three have achieved great[N]
feats[Beat] but that was years ago.[AN]
They act superior and walk over[N]
people because of their past.[AN]

I just don't know.


Princess.[.6] Will they still call you 'traitor'[N]
when they die,[.4] looking to Her eyes?[AN]
Or will they see the savior of Aeteria, and[N]
the second coming of Aeteria's Ashen Rider?[AN]

Dude.[.6] Can you stop being[N]
so dramatic?[AN]
Sheesh[Beat] It's not like there's[N]
a choir playing behind you.[AN]

# Wreyvine
General Wustenhoff.[.6] Father Ogrim.[.6][N]
We welcome your return.[AN]
I trust Wreyvine's holy guard have[N]
found great success?[AN]
[Pause]Have you found a vessel capable of[N]
wielding the Eye of Creation?[AN]
A vessel attuned with heaven,[.4] chosen[N]
by the Hallowed One.[AN]

Your Majesty.[.6] There's been an[N]
infiltration in the prison.[AN]

Half of it was burnt,[.4] and the other[N]
half was riddled with holes![AN]
