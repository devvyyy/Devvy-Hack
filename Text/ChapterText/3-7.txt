[ML][Aoife][R][Eustace][FR][Maynard]

[ML]
You know[,] we should really do this[N]
more often.[.6] An actual meeting with all[N]
of us in one room.[AN]
Really beats the whole warping for a[N]
quick message thing we had to do a[N]
few month back.[AN]

[R]
Silence[,] Consul Aoife.[.6] The Emperor has grown[N]
impatient.[.6] And with every step[,][N]
they corner us like wolves.[AN]

[FR]
Urgh[,] this has escalated far beyond[N]
what I ever imagined[Beat] We're[N]
on the brink of desperation here.[AN]
The south bleeds while the border shakes.[6N]
And the Emperor sends us to play house[N]
at his doorstep.[AN]

[ML][MoveML]
Oh[,] come on[,] Maynard![.6] You sound[N]
so dire[Beat] It's so unlike you![AN]

[FR]
You act like we're not at war[,] like it's[N]
still the [OpenQuote]glory days" where you'd be[N]
sipping on wine or whatever.[AN]

[ML]
Those were the good days[,] though[,] eh?[6N]
The Apostle[,] playing piano[,] as that statesman[N]
would critique her technique.[AN]
Gods[,] he'd be like [OpenQuote]Whoa[,] whoa[,] whoa[,] the[N]
keys ain't runnin' away![.6] C'mon[,] you're playin'[N]
for you.[.6] Try one last song."[AN][C]
Every day was almost like[Beat] a vacation.[AN]

[FR]
If you wanted a vacation[,] *Consul*[Beat][N]
There's a villa south of Vale.[6N]
I hear they have quite the fine coffee.[AN]

[R]
That ghost that's fighting with them[Beat][N]
I can't discern anything about[N]
his identity.[AN]
Now that he fights with the united front[,][N]
this rebellion's gone out of hand.[6N]
Not to mention Sylmeria's there[,] too[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Their leader is nothing.[.6] Without the ability[N]
to tame the Serpent[,] she'll just go loose[N]
and maybe even help us out here.[AN]

[R]
The princess has grown teeth.[6N]
You underestimate her prowess[,] Aoife.[6N]
You saw what damage she did.[AN]

[ML]
Oh[,] please.[.6] I underestimate nothing[,] Eustace.[6N]
I had her in a cell under Vale's deepest.[6N]
Buuuut the Apostle had to let her loose.[AN]
A few piano lessons was all it took for[N]
for their dual-wielding spark to get her army[N]
back and come scurrying over here.[AN]

[FR]
And to think I could've had the chance to[N]
stop this[,] salted the seed before[N]
it sprouted.[.6] Years ago[Beat][AN]

[ML]
You sound so calm![6N]
Is that permission to let us blame all[N]
this on you[,] Maynard?[AN]

[FR]
Shove off[,] Aoife.[.6] If we fall[,] let them[N]
take the castles and regroup with[N]
the Emperor.[AN]
Then it'll be our last stand[,] got it?[6N]
Just gotta hope Selwyn's got enough[N]
strength to throw them off the castle.[AN]

[R]
You both have let the lost heir survive?[6N]
Heavens[,] what choice do we have but[N]
to correct this.[AN]

[ML]
[OpenQuote]Let" is doing quite a bit of heavy[N]
lifting here[,] don't you think?[6N]
These weren't accidents.[AN]

[FR]
Shoulda never have let Sylmeria near her[,][N]
what with her soft heart and all.[AN]

[R]
The real problem is that people want to[N]
believe.[.6] That Order[Beat] How could we have[N]
overlooked such a thorn?[AN]

[ML]
Until recently[,] I thought that Mariya fellow[N]
was some nameless politician.[.6] I mean[,] he[N]
spoke in such an uncourtly manner[Beat][AN]
To think that Graham was the snake behind[N]
it all[,] with him as a front[Beat][N]
It was impossible to know.[AN]

[FR]
Enough talk[,] you two.[.6] First light[,] at[N]
Greywatch[,] Velden[,] Ashring.[6N]
A war on three fronts.[AN]

## Part3Chapter7Opening2
# triple seize; party talk; this takes place in VALE[,] amidst AETERIA'S TRIFOLD BASTION; called it the standing points
[3L]

[ML][Chiffon][R][LoadAffoSwitch][FR][Ulrich]

[R]
There's three castles ahead of us.[.6][N]
Three crowns of Aeteria[,] each fortified[N]
by a Consul.[AN]
There's no turning back now.[6N]
These are the last pillars standing in[N]
our way before the throne.[AN]

[ML]
The forces against us are great[,][N]
but we've surmounted everything that's[N]
tried to stop us before.[AN]
We'll break through them[,] conquer these[N]
castles[,] and get our way to the[N]
empire's Bastion.[AN]

[FR]
We're forced to split our forces here.[6N]
Any hesitation[,] and I'm sure one force[N]
will be overwhelmed.[AN]
You really sure about this?[.6][N]
The empire's Standing Points are known[N]
for a damn good reason.[AN]
The locals still call it Triarc.[.6] Old name[,][N]
older legacy.[.6] Three keeps across the ridge[N]
like jaws.[.6] That's where they're nesting.[AN]
If we aren't ready for this[,] then we'll[N]
be stalled at the ridge[,] caught up to[,][N]
and slaughtered by the Emperor's forces.[AN]

[R]
We've no time to prepare anymore.[6N]
That was it.[.6] After that[,] we hit a[N]
point of no return.[AN]
If the empire can hold the line through[,][N]
Ideon will fall to winter.[.6] The world[N]
will become nothing but ice.[AN]

[ML]
Consul Maynard holds Greywatch to the west.[6N]
Lady Vida[Beat] Because of him[Beat] She[Beat][N]
I[Beat] I'll take him down![AN]

[FR]
The crimson-haired Consul takes hold of[N]
Castle Velden at the center.[.6] It's[N]
defended through rough mountains.[AN]
Ashring Hold's the east-most castle[,] and[N]
Consul Eustace takes a hold of it.[6N]
I'm not sure what to expect[,] honestly.[AN]
[CSS]
[ML][MoveLeft]

[FL][Raial]
Time's gonna be short here[,] Apsiel.[.6][N]
No way Selwyn's forces won't relentlessly[N]
pursue us through the storm all dawn.[AN]
Dress warmly[,] this'll be a long battle.[6N]
We'll need swift[,] decisive action.[6N]
No more time to waste![AN]

[FR]
Then we move now.[.6] Everybody knows their[N]
position[,] right?[.6] No more mistakes![AN]

[ML][LoadAffoSwitch][MR][Chiffon]

[ML]
Alright[,] then[Beat] This is it.[6N]
Consuls now[,] and then we have a straight[N]
road to the throne and the altar.[AN]

[MR]
There's no time to worry about the[N]
details.[.6] I'm sure the villages have[N]
already been evacuated.[AN]
We push straight through and take over[N]
the empire's beloved Standing Points[,][N]
and this war becomes far easier.[AN]

[ML]
On my signal.[AN][CSS]

[MR][MoveMidRight]
It's all or nothing![AN]

[3L]
[MR][Maynard]
Ah[,] so you've all come at last.[6N]
I wondered how many more battles I[N]
would see before the shores greet me.[AN]
Welcome to Greywatch.[.6] This fortress has[N]
held through harsher winters than even[N]
the bluescarves could imagine.[AN]
You think you've earned the right[N]
to take it from me?[.6] Then go ahead[N]
and try to breach it.[AN]

[ML][Soldier2][MR][Maynard]

[ML]
Consul[,] the northern plains grow restless[Beat][N]
Fleets of refugees clog the passes.[6N]
Should we give up this front?[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]They flee the cold[,] son.[.6] If you wish[N]
to gather your things and flee with them[,][N]
then don't stop running.[AN][C]
I understand their grief better than most.[AN]

[ML]
I can't abandon you[,] Maynard.[.6][N]
If I die[,] I'm glad to have fought[N]
by your side.[AN]

[MR]
Such brazen tenacity[Beat] That lucent who[N]
leads them wields power beyond her years.[6N]
Sigh[Beat] It reminded me of Rivi.[AN]

[ML]
I hear there was an evacuation at Valeguard.[6N]
Your boy's with you in Omios[,] then?[AN]

[MR]
No[,] he died last autumn[,] before the war.[6N]
It was fever that laid him to the shores.[AN]

[ML]
I'm sorry[,] sir.[.6] I didn't know.[AN]

[MR]
Wasn't my place to put that on you.[6N]
You have my apologies.[.6] In a way[,] I'm[N]
happy he won't see what's coming.[AN]
To freeze is to succumb.[.6] Resist temptation.[.6][N]
I hope you can avoid the frozen shores[N]
for as long as I live[,] son.[AN]

[ML]
Always[,] Consul.[.6] Moonlight guide us.[AN]

[ML][Soldier][MR][Aoife]

[ML]
Consul![.6] The golden-eyed demon from the bridge.[6N]
She was captured[.4]--h-how could she be[N]
leading that ragtag force now?[AN]

[MR]
Yes[,] darling.[.6] Haha![.6] I remember delivering[N]
her personally to Sylveria's doorstep.[6N]
Quite the spry spirit for a captive.[AN]

[ML]
Didn't expect her to slip away from[N]
the Apostle[,] of all people.[AN]

[MR]
I underestimated her dear sister's soft heart.[6N]
The Apostle can be quite sentimental[Beat][N]
A flaw that'll surely be fixed in time.[AN]

[ML]
Your coffee's really strong[,] ma'am.[6N]
But[,] uh[,] it really steadies the nerves.[6N]
Why is it so[Beat] bitter[,] though?[AN]

[MR]
Don't complain[,] soldier.[.6] This is a premium[N]
brew--[.4]cream of the cream type stuff--[.4][N]
from the kingdom's ashen coast.[AN]
I even put sugar in yours![.6] If you can't[N]
handle it[,] there's chocolate in the castle.[6N]
Go knock yourself out.[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]Pardon me for a moment.[AN]

[MR][Eustace]
Do you feel the winds of finality[Beat]?[6N]
The night ahead will be harsh and arduous[Beat][AN]

[ML][Soldier3]
Consul.[.6] They approach from the south.[6N]
I fear we have little time remaining[,][N]
especially in such conditions.[AN]

[MR]
Our spells are ready.[.6] They will not[N]
survive such a volley of the arcane.[6N]
Do not saddle yourself with fear now.[AN]

[ML]
We should've waited for the Apostle[N]
to complete the rite[Beat] Then that way[N]
the enemy stands no chance.[AN]

[MR]
Time is fleeting[,] of the essence[,] even now[Beat][N]
Get in position.[.6] Time owes loyalty to[N]
naught but itself.[AN]

[MR][Eustace]
You stand before the Ashring Hold[,] soldier.[6N]
Allow me to greet you with heraldy;[4N]
a brief reminder of its history.[AN]
[Pause]Bah[,] what's the damned point?[6N]
You're all gonna die anyways![.6N]
Now come![.6] Walk to your demise![AN]

[3L][CloseEyes]
Breathe.[AN][C]
Alright[Beat] Here goes[Beat][N][OpenEyes]
Everyone[,] it brings me joy to see all[N]
of you standing beside me today.[AN]
Today[,] we have penned the start[N]
of a brand new chapter in Ideon's[N]
long and fractured history.[AN]
This is the point of no return.[6N]
We have nowhere to go from here[N]
but onwards[,] to the Emperor.[AN]

[CSS]

I[,] Sylmeria of the Aeterian Empire[,][N]
would like to address all of you:[4N]
the heroes who made this happen.[AN]
Look around you![.6] Look at all that[N]
we have accomplished today![6N]
Do you know how it was done?[AN]
Can you recognize how we struck[N]
such a mighty blow against the[N]
Emperor's pride and joy--[AN]
how we toppled the Standing Points[N]
and will now proceed to blaze ahead[,][N]
onto the Last Bastion?[AN][C]
What did we have in our repertoire[N]
that Emperor Selwyn lacked?[AN]

[CSS][Event]

Unity.[.6] Wreyvine and Aeteria,[4N]
hand in hand.[.6] Two halves made[N]
whole once more.[AN]
It was only the united strength of[N]
Wreyvian steel and the Aeterian[N]
powers that made today possible.[AN]
The Emperor invaded Wreyvine[N]
because he wished to see Ideon[N]
beneath one flag again[Beat][AN]
But he has done nothing but sow[N]
discord within Wreyvine's soil--[.4][N]
salting them so unity cannot grow![AN]
His strides towards his [OpenQuote]unity" only[N]
widened the gap between the[N]
Wreyvian and Aeterian colors![AN]
And in doing so[,] he only drove[N]
Ideon farther away from the[N]
peace it yearns for so dearly![AN]
True unity is born from an absence[N]
of internal strife.[.6] And conquest[Beat][N]
only forces us farther apart.[AN]

[CSS]

My companions[Beat] we have accomplished[N]
much together.[.6] With Captain Raial by[N]
my side[,] we are unstoppable.[AN]
We have reclaimed castles[Beat][N]
conquered mighty foes[Beat][N]
and so[,] so much more than that.[AN]
But never forget that the United[N]
Liberation Army's greatest feat--[.4][N]
the one history will remember--[AN]
is our capacity to look past[N]
the that drove us apart,[4N]
and become whole once again![AN]
Regardless of who we are or[N]
where we hail[,] our hearts beat to[N]
the rhythm of the very same drum![AN]
We are more than the Resistance[N]
and the Order[,] more than merely[N]
Aeteria and Wreyvine![AN]
No[,] we strike as one Ideon[Beat][N]
and THAT is why we cannot lose![6N]
My friends[Beat] my comrades[Beat][AN]
The Emperor[,] hiding away in the Bastion[N]
is the one obstacle that still remains[N]
in our path.[AN]
So will you join me[,] one more time?[6N]
Will you stand by my side and raise[N]
your arms for one last battle?[AN]

Phew.[AN][C]
Alright[Beat] Here goes[Beat][N][OpenEyes]
Everyone[,] it brings me joy to see all[N]
of you standing beside me today.[AN]
Today[,] we have penned the start[N]

What did we have in our repertoire[N]
that Emperor Selwyn lacked?[AN]

[CSS][Event]

Direction.[.6] Purpose[,] clear as the[N]
moonlit night sky.[.6] The invisible[N]
forces that bring us strength in pain.[AN]
Let me ask you this:[.4] can any of[N]
you tell me exactly WHAT the[N]
Emperor has accomplished[AN]
since he cut down the good[N]
King Anatolius and sat himself[N]
upon the Wreyvian throne?[AN]
He claims to fight for unity[,] but[N]
what has he brought to Ideon?[N]
Nothing but disorder![.6] Chaos![AN]
Ideon has never been closer[N]
to fracturing in two[,] all thanks[N]
to the work of Emperor Selwyn![AN]
He rules the land with a foolish mind[N]
clouded with dreams of power[Beat][N]
power without purpose.[AN]
But us?[.6] Every man and woman[N]
standing alongside you has[N]
rallied under my banner,[AN]
and for one purpose:[.4] to bring[N]
an end to Selwyn's tyranny[,] and[N]
right the wrongs he has wrought![AN]
Friends of the Order[,] of the[N]
Resistance[,] of Aeteria[,] of Wreyvine[Beat][N]
Excellence is measured in sacrifice.[AN]
The Last Bastion is now the one obstacle[N]
that still remains in our path.[6N]
The ashes of war will rise.[AN]
The rule of Emperor Selwyn will be a[N]
quiet flicker like a candleflame,[4N]
and I will ensure that.[AN]
So[,] will you stand behind me[N]
as I take the last steps necessary[N]
to right Ideon's last wrongs?[AN]
The Emperor has kept Ideon[N]
under a moonlit shroud for[N]
far too long[,] my friends.[AN]
Join me[,] and we shall bring[N]
about a new dawn for the[N]
land we all call home![AN]
