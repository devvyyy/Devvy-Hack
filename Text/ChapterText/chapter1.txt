[OpenFarLeft][LoadSoldier2][OpenLeft][LoadShaman][OpenMidRight][LoadBiscotti]
[OpenLeft]So boss,[.4] what's[N]
the deal,[.4] here?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Wreyvine is so damned cold[Beat][.6] Why[N]
the heck are we here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Our beloved Queen-[.4] [CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]may the Ashen Rider[N]
bless her soul until the end of days-[OpenEyes][ToggleSmile][AN]
has entrusted us to watch[N]
this place.[AN]
Said to look out for[N]
[OpenQuote]knightly blokes".[AN]
We are to [OpenQuote]utterly annihilate[N]
and obliterate" them.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][Pause]I have no idea what[N]
that means,[.4] boss.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Just go along with it.[.6] I think Her[N]
Majesty's in her cups,[.4] as always.[AN]
[MoveMidRight]Er-[.4] don't tell her I[N]
said that[Beat][AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Oi,[.4] there's Wreyvian knights[N]

## Ch1Opening1
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadAffo][OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]I have finished scouting[N]
the area,[.4] sir.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Anything noteworthy?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]There's many footprints[N]
in the snow,[.4] sir.[AN]
[Pause]We aren't the only[N]
ones here.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Did you find the source[N]
of those prints?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Aeterian knights are outside.[.6] I[N]
suggest we find another route,[.4] sir.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Unfortunate[Beat] The path through the river[N]
is the fastest way to the palace.[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]Sir Ulrich![A][X]

## Ch1Opening2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadNora]
[OpenLeft][LoadSequin]
[OpenRight][LoadAffo][OpenFarRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenLeft]We finally found you.[.6][N]
We were worried sick![AN]
[OpenFarRight]Nora,[.4] Sequin?[.6] What are you[N]
two doing here?[AN]
I thought you recruits were still[N]
looking for provisions.[AN]
[OpenLeft]We got worried,[.4] so[N]
now we're here.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]What took you all so long,[.4][N]
everyone?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]We had an encounter with Aeterian[N]
knights in the ruins.[AN]
The ruins are secured,[.4] just as[N]
His Majesty requested.[AN]
[OpenRight]There's more of them outside.[.6][N]
We have to be careful.[A][X]

## Ch1Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich][OpenMidRight][LoadAffo]
[OpenMidRight][Pause]Wow,[.4] there's way more Aeterians[N]
than I originally saw.[AN]
They are really out to[N]
get us,[.4] huh?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Where are these soldiers[N]
coming from?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]Yeah,[.4] seriously.[.6] Isn't the great bridge[N]
connecting the two kingdoms miles away?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We have to ready ourselves[N]
for the night.[AN]
They're headed for us-[.4] let us[N]
take them down quickly.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Got it.[.4] We're all[N]
ready to go.[AN][X]

## AffoUlrichCh1Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffo]
[OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidLeft]This place seems[N]
familiar.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Because we were here just[N]
a few dozen minutes ago?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Well[Beat] Yeah.[.6] But I don't mean[N]
it like that.[AN]
It feels like[Beat][N]
something else.[AN]
Something I can't quite[N]
identify.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]A little cryptic,[.4][N]
huh?[AN]
Well,[.4] there's no use in[N]
worrying about it now.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Mm,[.4] you're right.[.6] I'll figure it[N]
out eventually.[AN][X]

## SeqEvelTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSequin]
[OpenMidRight][LoadEvelyn]
[OpenMidLeft]Nora,[.4] how are you[N]
holding up?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The same as ever,[.4][N]
I suppose.[AN]
I'm just worried about[N]
my old man.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I wouldn't be too[N]
worried.[AN]
He's a lieutenant of the royal[N]
guard,[.4] isn't he?[AN]
[MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There's no way anyone[N]
can defeat him![AN]
[OpenMidRight][Pause]Yeah,[.4] I guess[Beat][.6] Sorry,[.4] I don't[N]
really want to talk about it[Beat][AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A][X]

## AnsgarBreveTalk
[OpenFarLeft][LoadAnsgarRight][OpenLeft][LoadAnsgarLeft][OpenMidRight][LoadBreve]

[OpenLeft]
Huff[Beat] I'll never be able to[N]
catch up with the likes of ya[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Affogato and Sequin can catch up[N]
with us riders just fine.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Affogato's practically cheatin'.[.6] Do ya[N]
see him dash past everyone?[AN]
That isn't fair,[.4] I say.[.6] Why can't[N]
I do that?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Didn't Sir Ulrich offer you a mount?[.6][N]
Why didn't you take the offer?[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Well,[.4] it's too late for that[N]
now,[.4] eh?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Well,[.4] I got an idea[N]
for you,[.4] Ansgar.[AN]


[OpenLeft]
Shoot.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Why don't you try using your shield[N]
as a sled or something?[AN]

[OpenLeft]
[Pause]And ya lost me.[AN][X]

[OpenLeft]They're[Beat] The Aeterians are[N]
retreating.[.6] It's over.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Orders,[.4] sir?[.6] Should we[N]
give chase?[AN]
[OpenRight][Pause]No.[.6] Their forces are scattered[N]
and weakened.[AN]
There's no reason for us[N]
to continue pursuing them.[AN]
We'd only be putting ourselves[N]
in more danger[Beat][AN]
[OpenFarRight]I'm glad this is finally over. [CloseEyes]May[N]
the Hallowed King guide us[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][LoadHildr]
Phew,[.4] It's getting[N]
dark,[.4] everyone.[AN]
There's a valley en route to[N]
the palace.[AN]
[OpenLeft][LoadAffo][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidRight][LoadSequin]
[OpenMidRight]We could all use a break[N]
after that.[AN]
Let's make camp there[N]
for the night.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What are we waiting for,[.4] then?[N]
I'll try to scout ahead[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]I'll come with you.[.6] Last I checked,[.4][N]
there should be a village nearby.[A][X]

## Ch1EndingAlt1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffo]
[OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir Ulrich,[.4] the rest of the[N]
Aeterians are retreating.[.6][AN]
Should we give chase?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][Pause]No.[.6] They have all[N]
scattered.[AN]
We're down soldiers,[.4] yet we[N]
did not break.[.6] I'm glad.[AN]
The road ahead is going to[N]
be difficult.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We should use this time to[N]
prepare for our next battle.[AN]
There's a valley on the route[N]
towards the King's palace.[AN] 
Let's make camp there[N]
for the night.[AN]
It's getting dark,[.4][N]
I'll scout ahead.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Godspeed,[.4] Affogato.[A][X]

[OpenRight]I didn't have time to[N]
give this to ya last time.[AN]

## Ch1Ending3Alt2Point5

[OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEvel]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you sure you should[N]
be so far from the fire,[.4] sir?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Something's been on my[N]
mind,[.4] Nora.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]I'll be fine.[.6] You stay with[N]
the others.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]It feels like the cold season[N]
is never going to stop.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][Pause]It really does seem that[N]
way,[.4] hm?[AN]
Crops would've thawed by this[N]
time in previous years.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah[Beat] It just feels uneasy[Beat][.6][N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffogato]
[OpenMidRight]Good to see you,[.4] Affogato.[AN]
So,[.4] did you find anything[N]
of note?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah,[.4] the Aeterians seem to[N]
be everywhere[Beat][AN]
A man in a brown coat told me they[N]
were headed for the palace.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]Hmm,[.4] [OpenEyes]This is certainly[N]
troubling.[AN]

That's not all.[.6] I inquired the[N]
villagers about the ruins.[AN]
They said they see[Beat] shadows[N]
creeping near the forests.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That's odd.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The barkeep told me to come[N]
back at dawn.[AN]
He wanted us to help "take care[N]
of some thieves".[AN]
I think we have time to take[N]
a detour before the march.[AN]

It's rare 'round these[N]

None of us were built to[N]

Even a simple spell could put[N]
you one foot in the grave.[AN]
It's simply the order[N]
of Ideon.[AN]
Now the Aeterians on the[N]

They're pretty devout,[.4] worshippers[N]

[MidLeft]That's odd,[.4][N]
isn't it?[AN]
The villagers gifted me a ring[N]
for playing at the tavern.[AN]
Apparently it's good for warding[AN]
yourself against dark magic.[AN]
I have to be on my[N]
