[OpenLeft]So[,] what's the dealio here[,] cap'n?[AN]

[FL]
I know right[Beat]? Wreyvine is way too cold.[6N]
And uncivilized.[.6] Why the hell are we here?[AN]

[MR]
Hear me![.6] I shall educate your ignorance![6N]
Our beloved Duke Selwyn of Omios--[.4]may the[N]
Ashen Rider bless his eternal soul--[AN]
wants to annihilate ALL of Wreyvine to[N]
avenge the fallen empress.[.6] *ahem*[.6][N]
He said to look out for 'knightly blokes'.[AN][Clear]
We are to[,] [OpenQuote]utterly annihilate and obliterate"[N]
them.[.6] That's all he wrote[,] anyways.[AN]

[FL]
I don't think the Duke would say the[N]
first part.[.6] Or the second.[.6][N]
[Pause]Or the third[,] actually[Beat][AN]

[L]
Captain Biscotti[,] can you be a little clearer?[6N]
I'm just here waiting for orders[,] man.[AN]

[MR]
Silence[,] both of you![.6] Ahem.[.6] First, we must[N]
find Wreyvian soldiers.[.6] Next[,] we kill them[N]
on their own soil![AN]
Then[,] afterwards[,] we get paid![.6N]
Lots of gold![.6] And now[Beat] we start with[N]
step one:[.4] we watch for our prey[,] and[Beat][AN]

[FL]
Hey![.6] There's Wreyvian knights over there![AN]

Where are they?[.6] It's been hours[Beat][N]
Should we go in and check?[AN]

[FFR]
Sequin![.6] Nora![.6] You members of the 8th platoon[N]
were supposed to stay at Castle Wreyvine.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveMidRight]

[L]
But Captain[,] sir![.6] Didn't you hear the news--[.4][N]
see all those Aeterians everywhere?![.6] I tried[N]
to rob one but he wouldn't let me![AN]

[MR]
Yes[,] we fought off a few soldiers[N]
back there[Beat][AN]

[L]
We just ran away from ours.[.6] Let's hope[N]
they aren't still chasing us.[AN]

[MR]
Ahem.[.6] Anyways[,] the ruins are secured[,][N]
just as His Majesty requested.[.6] But now we[N]
have to deal with this mess.[AN]
I do wonder how they got here so quickly[Beat][N]
The bridge connecting the two countries[N]
is hundreds of miles away.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveRight]

[FFR][LoadAffogato][MoveFarRight]
Sir.[.6] We're surrounded by presumably Aeterian[N]
soldiers.[.6] I suspected enough from all of[N]
the fresh prints in the snow.[AN]

We have to ready ourselves for the night.[.6][N]

[MR][MoveMidRight]
Oho![.6] Mages?[.6] Sir Ulrich[,] can you[N]
gimme permission to cast magic?[.6N]
The deadly[,] burning kind.[AN]
My old commander said magic was[N]
outlawed unless you were one of[N]
Wreyvine's faithful.[AN][Clear]
Hell![.6] I couldn't even find any[N]
tomes in any of the stores.[.6] How[.6N]
am I supposed to get one?[AN]

[ML]
That's because magical warfare is outlawed[Beat][N]
Magic is strictly prohibited in Wreyvine[N]
unless you work for the holy guard.[AN][Clear]
It's better that way[,] trust me.[.6] There's[N]
fewer unintended casualties.[AN]

[MR]
And what if I pick up a lil' tome from[N]
a dead Aeterian?[AN]

[ML]
Then I can't stop you.[6N]
Go right ahead.[AN]

you 'don't remember'[,] that's not how[N]
it works?[.6] You have memories[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
They're scattered[,] unreliable[,] and[Beat][N]
they feel as though they don't belong[N]

I was hoping our earlier battle would[N]
clear the haze[,] but it only briefly[N]
flickered my memories.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Alright[,] nevermind.[.6] Are you sure[N]
you're fit to join the army[Beat]?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]I wouldn't be too[N]

He's a lieutenant of the royal[N]

much effort for you,[.4] Ansgar?[AN]
Affogato and Sequin can catch up[N]

[OpenLeft]
Affogato's practically cheatin'.[.6] Do ya[N]
see him dash past everyone?[AN]
That isn't fair,[.4] I say.[.6] Why can't[N]
I do that?[AN]

Didn't Sir Ulrich offer you a mount?[.6][N]
Why didn't you take the offer?[AN]

[OpenMidRight][Pause]No.[.6] They have all scattered.[.6][N]
We're down soldiers,[.4] and we can't take[N]
unnecessary risks.[.6] We can't break.[AN][Clear]
The road ahead is going to be[Beat][N]
very difficult.[.6] Let's be careful.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
We should use this time to prepare for[N]
our next battle.[.6] There's a valley[N]
on the route towards the King's palace.[AN] 
I'd be wise to make camp there for[N]
the night.[.6] It's getting dark soon,[.4][N]
