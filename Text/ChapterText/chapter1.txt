What happened here?[AN]
Brigands lie in wait outside[N]

won't be too happy about this.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah,[.4] yeah.[OpenMidLeft]I'm just here[N]
for the gold![AN]
If y'all wanna appease the boss[N]

Where could they be[N]
headed[Pause]?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]There's a village near[N]
the capital.[AN]
If that's where they're[N]
going,[AN]
It would be wise to secure[N]
the village.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[OpenMidRight]Got it,[.4] let's move![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][Pause]I don't like this.[.6][N]
Their leader is dead,[.4] are[N]
they not?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[OpenMidRight]Yet they still have[N]
someone in command.[AN]
Where did this influx of[N]
shamans come from[Beat]?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I fear for the worst[N]
for Wreyvine's future.[AN]
Still,[.4] we must press on.[.6] There's[N]

Sequin[.6] And even then,[.4] wh-[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
[OpenMidLeft]Not falling behind?[.6][N]
You're three steps behind everyone[N]
else![AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[OpenMidRight]That's because I'd prefer[N]
to not die here.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Where's the thrill[N]
in that?[AN]
Think of the treasure here,[.4][N]
we could be rich![AN]
Amidst this rubble,[.4][N]
fortune awaits us![AN]

[OpenLeft]Sir Ulrich,[.4] the rest of the[N]
brigands are retreating.[.6][AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Orders,[.4] sir.[.6] Should we[N]
give chase?[AN]
[OpenRight][Pause]No.[.6] They have all[N]
scattered.[AN]
There's no reason for us[N]
to continue pursuing them.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]We'd only be putting ourselves[N]
in more danger[Beat][AN]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][LoadHildr]
Those brigands can't do anything[N]
without their leader.[AN]
I'm certain the village will[N]
be safe.[AN]

[OpenMidRight][Pause]No.[.6] They have all[N]
scattered.[AN]
They're nothing by themselves.[.6][N]
The village will be safe.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffo]
We should use this time to[N]
prepare for our next battle.[N]
It's getting dark,[.4][N]
I'll scout ahead.[AN]

That bow[Beat][.6] It's incredible-[.4][N]
did you make that?[AN]
[OpenRight]Indeed.[.6] I've been waitin' a[N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadEvel]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you sure you should[N]
be so far from the fire,[.4] sir?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Something's been on my[N]
mind,[.4] Nora.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]I'll be fine.[.6] You stay with[N]
the others.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]It feels like the cold season[N]
is never going to stop.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][Pause]It really does seem that[N]
way,[.4] hm?[AN]
Crops would've thawed by this[N]
time in previous years.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah[Beat] It just feels uneasy[Beat]
[ToggleSmile]But the fire is nice and cozy[Beat][AN][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffogato]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
Good to see you,[.4] Affogato.[.6][N]
So,[.4] did you find anything[N]
of note?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffo]
Yeah,[.4] apparently they were[N]
spotted heading for the capital.[AN]
The villagers said they were[N]
looking for a sort of tome.[AN]
Locals called it the '[ToggleRed]King's Eye[ToggleRed]'.[.6][AN]
Apparently it gives its user[N]
'perception beyond time'.[AN]
No clue what that means,[.4] and[N]
no idea to why they want it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]Hmm,[.4] [OpenEyes]This is certainly[N]
troubling.[AN]
Take a good rest,[.4][N]
we march tomorrow at dawn.[A][X]
