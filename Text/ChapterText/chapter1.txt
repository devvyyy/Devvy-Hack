[OpenMidLeft]Come,[.4] this way![AN]
[OpenFarRight]It's good to see you[N]
in one piece,[.4] Nora.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]
[OpenLeft][LoadSequin]
What happened here?[AN]
Brigands lie in wait outside[N]
the ruins.[AN]
[OpenRight]So that wasn't the[N]
last of them.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]
Let's get ready,[.4] then.[.6][N]
We march on.[A][X]

## Ch1Opening2
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x33][0x1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadShaman]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Good day.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You're the scout[Beat] Any[N]
updates on the plan?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course.[.6] The mission[N]
starts tomorrow.[AN]
[MoveMidRight]The boss knows a lot about the[N]
whereabouts of the guards.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]And any report on the[N]
other scouts?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]They're flying towards the[N]
city borders.[AN]
The boss called for reinforcements.[.6][N]
We meet up later.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBandit]What are you two[N]
here for?[AN]
Get in position![.6] The priest has[N]
fallen.[AN]
[MoveFarLeft]Now's the only chance we'll[N]
get to get the knights![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Right away.[AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidRight]
Where could they be[N]
headed[Pause]?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]There's a village near[N]
the capital.[AN]
If that's where they're[N]
going,[AN]
It would be wise to secure[N]
the village.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Got it,[.4] let's move![A][X]

## AffoUlrichCh1Talk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffo]
[OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidLeft][Pause]I don't like this.[.6][N]
Their leader is dead,[.4] right?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yet they still have[N]
someone in command.[AN]
Where did this sudden influx of[N]
shamans come from[Beat]?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I fear for the worst[N]
for Wreyvine's future.[AN]
Still,[.4] we must press on.[.6] There's[N]
no time for such thoughts.[A][X]

## SeqEvelTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSequin]
[OpenMidRight][LoadEvelyn]
[OpenMidLeft]Nora,[.4] how are you[N]
holding up?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The same as ever,[.4][N]
I suppose.[AN]
I'm just worried about[N]
my old man.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I wouldn't be too[N]
worried.[AN]
He's a lieutenant of the royal[N]
guard,[.4] isn't he?[AN]
[MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There's no way anyone[N]
can defeat him![AN]
[OpenMidRight][Pause]Maybe.[.6] Sorry,[.4] I don't[N]
really want to talk about it[Beat][AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A][X]

[OpenLeft]Sir Ulrich,[.4] the rest of the[N]
brigands are retreating.[.6][AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Orders,[.4] sir.[.6] Should we[N]
give chase?[AN]
[OpenRight][Pause]No.[.6] They have all[N]
scattered.[AN]
There's no reason for us[N]
to continue pursuing them.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]We'd only be putting ourselves[N]
in more danger[Beat][AN]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][LoadHildr]
Those brigands can't do anything[N]
without their leader.[AN]
I'm certain the village will[N]
be safe.[AN]
[OpenLeft][LoadAffo][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidRight][LoadSequin]
[OpenMidRight]We could all use a break[N]
after that.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It's getting dark, too.[.6][N]
I'll scout ahead.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]And I'm coming with you![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft]Sir Ulrich,[.4] the rest of the[N]
brigands are retreating.[.6][AN]
Should we give chase?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][Pause]No.[.6] They have all[N]
scattered.[AN]
They're nothing by themselves.[.6][N]
The village will be safe.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffo]
We should use this time to[N]
prepare for our next battle.[AN]
It's getting dark,[.4][N]
I'll scout ahead.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Godspeed,[.4] Affogato.[A][X]

## Ch1Ending4
[OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEvel]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you sure you should[N]
be so far from the fire,[.4] sir?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Something's been on my[N]
mind,[.4] Nora.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]I'll be fine.[.6] You stay with[N]
the others.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]It feels like the cold season[N]
is never going to stop.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][Pause]It really does seem that[N]
way,[.4] hm?[AN]
Crops would've thawed by this[N]
time in previous years.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah[Beat] It just feels uneasy[Beat][.6][N]
[ToggleSmile][MoveMidLeft][CloseEyes]But the fire is nice and cozy[Beat][AN][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffogato]
[OpenMidRight]Good to see you,[.4] Affogato.[AN]
So,[.4] did you find anything[N]
of note?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffo]
Yeah,[.4] apparently they were[N]
spotted heading for the capital.[AN]
The villagers said they were[N]
looking for a sort of tome.[AN]
Locals called it the 'King's Eye'.[.6][AN]
Apparently it gives its user[N]
'perception beyond time'.[AN]
No clue what that means,[.4] and[N]
no idea to why they want it.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]Hmm,[.4] [OpenEyes]This is certainly[N]
troubling.[AN]
Take a good rest,[.4][N]
we march tomorrow at dawn.[A][X]
