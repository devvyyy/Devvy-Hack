[OpenLeft]So[,] what's the dealio here[,] cap'n?[AN]

[FR]
I know right[Beat]? Wreyvine is way too cold.[6N]
Why the hell are we here?[AN]

[MR]
Listen[,] now![.6] I shall educate your ignorance![6N]
Our beloved Duke Selwyn of Omios--[.4]may the[N]
Ashen Rider bless his Aeterian soul--[AN]
wants to annihilate ALL of Wreyvine to[N]
avenge the fallen empress.[.6] *ahem*[.6] He[6N]
said to look out for 'all the knightly blokes'.[AN]
We are to[,] uh[,] [OpenQuote]utterly annihilate and obliterate"[N]
them.[.6] Or that's all he wrote[,] anyways.[AN]

[FL]
I don't think the Duke would say the[N]
first part.[.6] Or the second.[.6][N]
Or the third[,] actually[Beat][AN]

[L]
Captain Biscotti[,] can you be a little clearer?[6N]
I'm just here waiting for orders[,] man.[AN]

[MR]
Silence, both of you![.6] *ahem*[.6] First, we must[N]
find Wreyvian soldiers.[.6] Next, we kill them[N]
on their own soil![AN]
Then[,] afterwards[,] we get paid![.6N]
Lots of gold![.6] And now[Beat] we start with[N]
step one:[.4] we watch for our prey[,] and[Beat][AN]

[FL]
Hey![.6] There's Wreyvian knights over there![AN]

[MR]
What?![.6] Already?![.6] Come with me![.6N]
Annihilate[Beat] and obliterate them![.6] Ahaha![AN]

[FL]
Where are they?[.6] It's been hours[Beat][N]
Should we go in and check?[AN]

[FFR]
Sequin![.6] Nora![.6] You members of the 8th platoon[N]
were supposed to stay at Castle Wreyvine.[AN][MoveMidRight]

[L]
But Captain[,] sir![.6] Didn't you hear the news--[.4][N]
see all those Aeterians everywhere?![.6] I tried[N]
to rob one but he wouldn't let me![AN]

[MR]
Yes[,] we fought off a few soldiers back there[Beat][AN]

[L]
That soldier was much too fast[,][N]
I tell you.[.6] Unfair![AN]

[MR]
*ahem*[.6] Anyways[,] the ruins are secured[,][N]
just as His Majesty requested.[.6] But now we[N]
have to deal with this mess.[AN]
I do wonder how they got here so quickly[Beat][N]
The bridge connecting the two countries[N]
is hundreds of miles away.[AN][MoveRight]

[FFR][LoadAffogato][MoveFarRight]
Sir.[.6] We're surrounded by presumably Aeterian[N]
soldiers.[.6] I suspected enough from all of[N]
the fresh prints in the snow[,] but[Beat][AN]

[MR]
Understood.[.6] Everyone[,] get ready for battle.[6N]
We have to ready ourselves for the night.[.6] They're[N]
headed for us-[.4]let us take them down quickly.[AN]

[FFR]
Got it.[.6] We're all[N]
ready to move out.[A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidLeft]This place seems[N]
familiar.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Because we were here just[N]
a few dozen minutes ago?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Well[Beat] Yeah.[.6] But I don't mean[N]
it like that.[AN]
It feels like[Beat][N]
something else.[AN]
Something I can't quite[N]
identify.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]A little cryptic,[.4][N]
huh?[AN]
Well,[.4] there's no use in[N]

[OpenMidRight]The same as ever,[.4][N]
I suppose.[AN]
I'm just worried about[N]
my old man.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I wouldn't be too[N]
worried.[AN]
He's a lieutenant of the royal[N]
guard,[.4] isn't he?[AN]
[MoveMidLeft][ToggleSmile]There's no way anyone[N]
can defeat him![AN]
[OpenMidRight][Pause]Yeah,[.4] I guess[Beat][.6] Sorry,[.4] I don't[N]

catch up with the likes of ya[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidRight]
What,[.4] shield vaulting takes too[N]
much effort for you,[.4] Ansgar?[AN]
Affogato and Sequin can catch up[N]
with us riders just fine.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Affogato's practically cheatin'.[.6] Do ya[N]
see him dash past everyone?[AN]
That isn't fair,[.4] I say.[.6] Why can't[N]
I do that?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Didn't Sir Ulrich offer you a mount?[.6][N]
Why didn't you take the offer?[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Well,[.4] buddy,[.4] it's too late for[N]
that now,[.4] eh?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Well,[.4] I got an idea[N]
for you,[.4] Ansgar.[AN]

That's the end of them.[.6] Good riddance.[AN]

[FL]
Your orders[,] sir? Shall we give chase to the runaways?

[R]
No[,] we their forces are scattered[N]
and weakened.[A]
There's no reason for us[N]
to continue pursuing them.[AN]

[FR]
Yeah![.6] We'd only be putting ourselves[N]
in more danger[ToggleMouthMove].[....].[....].[....][ToggleMouthMove][A][ClearFace][LoadNora]

Should we give chase?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][Pause]No.[.6] They have all[N]
scattered.[AN]
We're down soldiers,[.4] yet we[N]
did not break.[.6] I'm glad.[AN]
The road ahead is going to[N]
be difficult.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We should use this time to[N]
prepare for our next battle.[AN]
There's a valley on the route[N]
towards the King's palace.[AN] 
Let's make camp there[N]

It's getting dark,[.4][N]

That's not all.[.6] I inquired the[N]

[OpenMidRight]That's odd.[AN]

He wanted us to help "take care[N]
