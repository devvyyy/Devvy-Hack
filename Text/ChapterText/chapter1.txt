[OpenLeft]So boss,[.4] what's[N]
the deal,[.4] here?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Wreyvine is so damned cold[Beat][.6] Why[N]

[OpenMidRight]Our beloved Queen-[.4] [CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]may the Dark Rider[N]
bless her soul until the end of days-[OpenEyes][ToggleSmile][AN]
has entrusted us to watch[N]
this place.[AN]
Said to look out for[N]
"knightly blokes".[AN]
We are to "utterly annihilate[N]
and obliterate" them.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][Pause]I have no idea what[N]
that means,[.4] boss.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Just go along with it.[.6] I think Her[N]
Majesty's in her cups.[AN]
[MoveMidRight]Er-[.4] don't tell her I[N]
said that[Beat][AN]

sir.[.6][AN]
[OpenFarLeft]What took you all so long,[.4][N]
everyone?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]We had an encounter with soldiers[N]

familiar.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Because we were here just[N]
a few dozen minutes ago?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Well[Beat] Yeah.[.6] But I don't mean[N]
it like that.[AN]
It feels like[Beat][N]
something else.[AN]
Something I can't quite[N]
identify.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]A little cryptic,[.4][N]
huh?[AN]
Well,[.4] there's no use in[N]

my old man.[AN]

worried.[AN]

be difficult.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We should use this time to[N]
prepare for our next battle.[AN]
