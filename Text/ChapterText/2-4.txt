[ML]
[Beat]And to think all this trouble would be led[N]
by some mercenary.[.6] Feh![.6] What drivel![AN]

[MR]
You're here on swift wings[,] General.[.6] Your esteem[N]
as our savior rings true.[AN]

[ML]
I bear no such title.[.6] All I work towards is[N]
to aid the people of the empire.[AN][MR][CF]

[R][LoadWellington][FR][LoadOpal]

[FR]
General Messel.[.6] We are playing cat and mouse.[N]
The cultists of the Blood Moon sect and the[N]
soldiers of the Resistance form the[AN]
Aeterian Liberation army;[.4] we cannot afford to[N]
underestimate such a manifold threat.[AN]

[ML]
I am not underestimating them.[.6] I am simply[Beat][N]
expressing my indignation.[.6] The army is stretched thin.[.6][N]
We stick our nose to the grindstone.[AN][C]
The Emperor says "excellent" and leaves it[N]
at that.[AN]

[FR]
We are generals of the empire[,] bound to[N]
our duty to fulfill His Grace's orders[,][N]
are we not?[AN][C]
Yet we waver in our convictions[Beat][N]
What kind of example are we setting[N]
for our allies?[AN]

[ML]
Pah[,] what is this nonsense?[.6] We didn't "waver"[N]
until the woefully unprepared Duke took[N]
control of Aeteria.[AN][C]
Because of him[,] the Imperial army's reputation[N]
will be sent to the wastes.[AN]

[FR]
General[,] inform the soldiers to close the gates[N]
of Omios.[.6] Under no circumstance can we[N]
allow the rebels to leave the city.[AN][C]
Fortify Omios![.6] Leave no gate unclosed![AN]

General Wulfric and I will trail the rebels.[6N]
We shall corner and capture them.[AN]

Messel
Capture the rebels[Beat]? The Emperor said not[N]
of taking prisoners[,] General.[AN]

Opal
General Messel[,] I believe we are at a point where we[N]
do not abide by every order[,] especially if they[N]
are[Beat][.6] foolish.[.6] Heed me.[AN]

Messel
I'll put my faith in you[,] General.[.6][N]
But do not misplace my trust.[.6][N]
I will head to the city gates at once.[AN]

[ML][Messel][MR][Opal]
[MR]
We have to stop and kill the rebels.[.6][N]
There is no other way.[AN]

[ML]
We of the Imperial guard put our faith in you[,][N]
General.[.6] I will head to the city gates[N]
at once.[AN]

[L][Chiffon]
Look over there.[AN]

[FL][Raya]
There's already a brawl happening in all the[N]
fracas.[.6] If you want to show me what you're[N]
capable of[,] now's the time.[an][C]
Let's get in there![AN]

[R][Verna]
Looks like there's no direct way out of the[N]
city:[.4] the gate is locked.[AN]

[FR][Jaye]
When has a little gate stopped us before?[AN][ClearFace]

[FR][Graham]
There is no turning back now.[.6] We are strong[N]
enough to pull through[,] no matter the odds.[AN]

[FL]
Who said anything about turning back?[6N]
We're going to break through those gates[N]
and tear 'em down![AN]

[ML]
Everyone[,] look.[.6] If we can take down the[N]
gatekeeper[,] then I'm sure we can remotely[N]
open the gate[,] too.[AN]

[R]
Then that'll be our ticket outta Omios.[.6][N]
Come on![AN]

[FR]
It looks like General Messel is leading their[N]
forces.[.6] Lead us well[,] Chiffon[,] or we will[N]
be caught in a relentless pursuit.[AN]

[L][Chiffon]
There's flagbearers among the enemy forces.[AN]

[R][Graham]
I suggest we take care of the empire's[N]
messengers before they find the[N]
chance to flee.[AN]

[FR][Raya]
Killing innocent forces like that doesn't[N]
stick right with me.[.6] I'm sure the Generals[N]
wouldn't be quite happy either.[AN]

[R]
They are not innocent[,] Captain;[.4] they are soldiers[N]
of the empire.[.6] If we show mercy[,] the tides will[N]
turn against us.[AN]

[L]
We can't let them alert reinforcements.[6N]
Shoot them all down[,] leader.[AN][AN]

[MR]
How irresponsible I am[,] letting the rebels escape[N]
the city.[.6] My sincere apologies[,] Opali.[AN]

[L]
General[,] do not slight yourself.[.6][N]
The city remains under control[,] and there[N]
is always more work to do.[an]

[MR]
I could've had this done[Beat][.6][N]
The rebels were all within reach[Beat][N]
But none were captured today.[AN]

[FL]
The Messel I knew was merciful to a fault.[6N]
Do not forsake that quality over a petty[N]
band of rebels.[AN]

[MR]
And I thought you pursued answers[,] General.[.6][N]
You told me these rebels are dangerous.[.6][N]
I must rectify my mistake and pursue them.[AN]
You two[,] please rest easy.[.6] I know the[N]
uprising has been difficult[,] but it will[N]
be over soon.[AN][CF]

[FFR][Soldier2][MMR]
I[Beat][.6] I bring a report from Major Hayes![.6][N]
General Opali.[.6] General Wellington.[.6] You two[N]
have been given new orders from the Duke.

[L]
[Beat]Continue.[.6] This cannot be good.[AN]

[MR]
It concerns Count Locro.[.6] Given that the rebels[N]
are headed towards the border[,] he requests[N]
personal bodyguards at his side.[AN]

[FL]
Excellent.[.6] I signed up as General to be a cover for[N]
human filth.[.6] That vain noble does nothing all[N]
day at his guard booth at the empire's edge[Beat][AN]

[L]
We do not have a choice in the matter[,] Wulfric.[.6][N]
Thank you[,] Ser.[.6] You may report back at once.[AN]

[MR]
Yes[,] General.[.6] May moonlight guide us.

How irritating[Beat] The count spends his time on[N]
authorizing grand spectacles of himself.[.6] He[N]
belives he's the first at risk?[AN]

[ML]
We accept his 'offer'[,] and will head towards[N]
the border and defend him.[.6] There is no[N]
other way.[AN]
