My Emperor[Beat] Might I inquire as to the purpose[N]
of such a abrupt summon?[.6] We haven't heard[N]
from you in a while.[AN]

[L]
A few moons longer and I would've thought[N]
you met the same fate as--[AN]

[FFR]
Allow me to extend my gratitude to you[N]
Consuls.[.6] Oblige me;[.4] pray tell the status of[N]
each of the kingdom's territories.[AN]

[FL]
It is nothing but satisfactory[,] my Emperor.[.6][N]
The north is bountiful.[.6] For what it lacks in[N]
soil[,] they offer in precious ore.[AN]

[L]
The knights of Wreyvine have little power in[N]
the matter.[.6] They scattered like mice.[6N]

Silence.[.6] You address the Emperor of Aeteria.[6N]
Do not presume you can speak so freely[N]
in my presence.[AN]

[L]
[Beat]Understood[,] my Emperor.[AN]

[FFR]
It has come to my attention that a man[N]
in the kingdom is on a lone quest to ignite[N]
the flames of rebellion.[AN]

[FL]
But[Beat] How could a single man hope to[N]
accomplish such a feat?[.6] Are we given[N]
a name?[.6] Anything to identify him?[AN]

[FFR]
We have no information on his identity.[6N]
But it only takes the smallest of sparks[N]
to light the grandest of fires.[AN]

How irresponsible I am[,] letting the rebels[N]
escape the city.[.6] You have my sincere[N]
apologies[,] Opali.[AN]

[L]
General[,] do not slight yourself.[.6][N]
The city remains under control[,] and there[N]
is always more work to do.[an]

[MR]
I could've had this done[Beat][.6][N]
The rebels were all within reach[Beat][N]
But none were captured today.[AN]

[FL]
The Messel I knew was merciful to a fault.[6N]
Do not forsake that quality over a petty[N]
band of rebels.[AN]

[MR]
And I thought you pursued answers[,] General.[.6][N]
You told me these rebels are dangerous.[.6][N]
I must rectify my mistake and pursue them.[AN]
You two[,] please rest easy.[.6] I know the[N]
uprising has been difficult[,] but it will[N]
be over soon.[AN][CF]

[FFR][Soldier2][MMR]
I[Beat][.6] I bring a report from Major Hayes![.6][N]

You two have been given new orders[AN]
from the Emperor.[AN][Event]

[Beat]Continue.[.6] This cannot be good.[AN]

[MR]
It concerns Count Locro.[.6] Given that the rebels[N]
are headed towards the border[,] he requests[N]
personal bodyguards at his side.[AN]

[FL]
Excellent.[.6] I signed up as General to be a[N]
cover for a vain noble who lazes about[N]
all day at his guard booth[Beat][AN]

[L]
We do not have a choice in the matter[,][N]
Wulfric.[.6] Thank you[,] Ser.[.6] You may[N]
report back at once.[AN]

Yes[,] General.[.6] May moonlight guide us.[AN]

Yes[,] in fact[Beat] Such dreadful sights.[6N]
Royal knights[,] fallen and still.[.6] The[N]
rest[,] chasing scattered leaves.[AN]

who will step forward?[AN]

I know you've been unhappy with our[,][N]
well[,] sudden change in leadership--[AN]

[ML]
Well[Beat] I can't deny that[N]
Chiffon's damn talented[,][N]
But making her our leader?[AN]

[MR]
I believe in her[,] at least from[N]
everything I've seen from her.[6N]
And I know that Graham's plan[Beat][AN]
that making her a symbol for[N]
the people to rally behind[Beat][N]
might turn the tide for us.[AN]

[ML]
Hey[,] I don't take issue with that.[6N]
It's something else bothering me.[AN]

[MR]
And that is[Beat]?[AN]

[ML]
I don't trust her not to leave[N]
one of us for dead yet.[.6] What if she[N]
goes feral and turns against us?[AN]
With the Captain[,] I can say for[N]
sure that she'd fight tooth and[N]
nail to ensure we all get out safe.[AN]
Can't say the same for Chiffon yet[,][N]
though.[.6] Too unpredictable.[6N]
Leaves me uneasy[Beat][AN]

[MR]
Huh[Beat] That's[Beat][AN]

[ML]
If there's one thing I know for sure[N]
about Captain Raial[Beat] she could[N]
never abandon one of her own.[AN]
Just knowing that[Beat] that there's[N]
someone who's got your back[Beat][N]
who cares enough to stick[AN]
their neck out[Beat][AN][C]
isn't that reassuring?[AN]

[MR]
I can see it[Beat][N]
But I don't think you have[N]
anything to worry about.[AN]
Chiffon doesn't strike me as the[N]
type to throw away the lives[N]

[MR]
Reverend[,] what's in store for me?[AN]

[ML]
A quaint question[,] Ser.[.6] I am not[N]
sure how to answer such a thing.[6N]
Perhaps a battle to be won?[AN]

[MR]
Well[,] I mean that I'm not really used[N]
to the whole leading thing.[.6] There's[N]
a lot of variables in combat[,] you know?[AN]
Things were simpler back when I was[N]
a mercenary who only really cared[N]
about shooting and eating.[AN]

[ML]
Our world is a complex one[,] Ser Chiffon.[.6][N]
If my lessons have a core moral[,] it is[N]
that we cannot allow history to cycle.[AN]
But I have faith in you[,] and so do[N]
your allies.[.6] May the guidance of[N]
the moon bless our steps.[AN]

[MR]
Really?[.6] I mean[,] Raial still seems pretty[N]
on the fence about my leadership.[AN]

[ML]
Worry not about Raial[,] Ser.[6N]
If there is one you cannot let down[,][N]
it is the people of the empire.[AN]
Shoot down General Messel's messengers.[6N]
We cannot allow them to leave the city[,][N]
lest they alert Imperial soldiers.[AN]
It is raw resolve that separates[N]
the most distinguished leaders[N]
from the weak-willed ones[,] Ser.[AN]
Your latent powers are only one[N]
of the many tools you will need[N]
to define Aeteria's future.[AN]
Having a sharp enough mind to make[N]
the decisions most difficult on the[N]
fly[,] gauging all relevant factors[Beat][AN][C]
That is just as important as keys to[N]
shape the empire.[AN]

All for Aeteria[,] no matter the cost.[AN]

[ML]
What troubles you[,] Raial?[AN]

[MR]
It's Chiffon[Beat] I'm worried about her.[6N]
Do you really think she's[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Do you still doubt her leadership?[6N]
Must we bring this up again[,] even after[N]
our thorough discussion earlier?[AN]

[MR]
It's not just that[,] Graham.[.6] Seeing[N]
her rush through the battlefield[N]
like a haze of light is[Beat][AN]
Well[,] I've never seen such power[N]
in my life before.[.6] I can see why[N]
you have faith in her abilities.[AN]

[ML]
But[Beat]?[AN]

[MR]
But I've also noticed more about her.[6N]
Like how[,] sometimes[,] her energy[N]
leaps ahead of her body.[AN]
How she has to rein herself in[N]
before she accidentally launches a[N]
bolt in one of our own.[AN]
It's like she's barely got her own[N]
powers under control[Beat][N]
Do you think she can handle it?[AN]

[MR]
Of course.[.6] Ser Chiffon told me herself[N]
that she's possessed this power all[N]
throughout her life.[AN]
But never has she had a tutor as[N]
attuned with the arcane as I am.[6N]
I know how to handle this.[AN]
I hope to guide her to hone her[N]
art--[.4]to refine her strength until[N]
it arises as a fine beam of light.[AN]

[ML]
So you hope to teach her to keep[N]
herself under control?[AN][C]
What if[Beat] Aren't you worried that[N]
she'll make a mistake in the heat of[N]
battle and accidentally shoot one of us?[AN]
Or even that she'll just[Beat] lose complete[N]
control and unleash her powers on[N]
any poor victim nearby?[AN][C]
Let's face it[,] Graham:[4N]
she's a loose cannon.[AN]

[MR]
I am not denying the possibility.[6N]
But that is why her training is[N]
of the utmost importance.[AN]
Through leading[,] she will thrive.[6N]
She will grasp total mastery over her mind[N]
body[,] and ascend above all of us.[AN]
She will be a living weapon--[.4]
an icon of a free[,] True Aeteria.[AN]

[ML]
[Beat]I still don't like this.[6N]
I damn well hope you know[N]
what you're doing.[AN]

You were doing fine back there at[N]
the start of the siege.[.6] What's[N]
causing your hesitation[,] lass?[AN]

[MR]
Uh[,] everything[,] I guess.[AN]

[ML]
This is a heavy burden on your shoulders[,][N]
I can understand that as a fellow leader.[6N]
But this is the battlefield now.[AN]
One blink of hesitation[,] especially[N]
with the way you run ahead alone[,][N]
and you're done for.[AN]

[MR]
I'm aware.[.6] That's the scary thing.[AN]

[ML]
If I have to be frank[,] you're supposed[N]
to be the beacon that holds us[N]
all together.[AN]
Play that role[,] but be careful and[N]
don't get too ahead of yourself.[6N]
Lacking mercy is a terrible look.[AN]
Even on the battlefield[,] we have to[N]
be wary of such things.[.6] I'd spare[N]
those messengers[,] for example.[AN]

[MR]
But[Beat] Won't we be left with more[N]
Imperial soldiers on our trail?[AN]

[ML]
So what?[.6] Our goal here is to escape[N]
the city[,] not to slaughter them.[6N]
They'll need to regroup eventually.[AN]
If we need men[,] we can call upon more[N]
from our side on my signal by visiting[N]
our hiding spot.[AN]

[MR]
I'm just not sure what path is[N]
mine to take[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Are you being swayed by the Reverend?[6N]

## OpalRaialBossQ
[ML][Opal]
And you must be the[N]
Captain Raial herself.[AN][CF]

[MR][Raial]
Y'know[,] you've always[N]
been a mystery to me.[AN]
I heard stories of you[N]
in your youth.[AN]
How you'd tear up Wreyvian[N]
formations like paper[Beat][AN]
Yet I'd never guess that[N]
this is the same woman.[AN][CF]

[ML][Opal]
Much has changed[Beat][AN]
I chased that old dream,[4N]
hoping it would bring me[AN]
meaning in my life[Beat][AN]
But I am that woman[N]
no more[,] Raial.[AN][CF]

[MR][Raial]
Are you?[AN]
Your axe style is still that[N]
of an annihilator.[AN]
One who razes.[6N]
Who burns.[AN][CF]

[ML][Opal]
It is a life long past[Beat][N]
a life I'd left behind.[AN][CF]

[MR][Raial]
But do you truly find[N]
meaning in this new life?[AN]
In serving Emperor Selwyn,[4N]
a man whose eyes are[AN]
clouded with cold mist?[AN]
In standing idly on duty,[4N]
unable to bring change[AN]
with your own hands,[AN]
watching as the Aeteria[N]
you know slowly decays?[AN][CF]

[ML][Opal]
[Beat]Enough.[6N]
I will hear no more.[AN]

## EdithWulfricBossQ

[ML][Wellington]
Lieutenant Edith?[AN]
Why are you standing[N]
alongside their ranks?[AN][CF]

[MR][Edith]
I closed my eyes to the[N]
Count's vile behaviors.[AN]
But Ser Chiffon opened them,[4N]
and I could not look away.[AN]
Having seen his atrocities,[4N]
how could I not desert?[AN]
Would you not have[N]
done the same[,] Wellington?[AN][CF]

[ML][Wellington]
Those recruits[Beat] we[N]
trained them personally[Beat][AN]
They had no right to[N]
be on the battlefield[Beat][AN][CF]

[X]

## GrahamWulfricBossQ

[ML][Wellington]
Do your ambitions ever[N]
end[,] Reverend?[AN]
Tell me[,] what do you aim[N]
to achieve with this[AN]
reckless power grab?[AN][CF]

[MR][Graham]
Is it so hard to believe[N]
that this gambit is the[AN]
farthest from self-serving?[AN][CF]

[ML][Wellington]
When your fingers always[N]
spin the pieces on the board[AN]
into shapes that you like?[6N]
Pardon me for doubting.[AN][CF]

[MR][Graham]
The Silver Serpent looks[N]
down favorably upon us.[AN]
She knows this is the[N]
correct course of action.[AN][CF]

[ML][Wellington]
Is that the lie you've[N]
been feeding your men?[AN]
Honeyed words will not[N]
alter the truth[,] Reverend.[AN]
But perhaps silencing you[N]
will change something.[AN][CF]

[X]

## YufkaWulfricBossQ

[ML][Wellington]
Out of all of the court,[4N]
you were the last one that[AN]
I'd expected to turn traitor,[4N]
Minister Yufka.[AN][CF]

[MR][Yufka]
[Beat]I will not lie to you.[AN]
Life within the court never[N]
felt quite right to me.[AN]
It was like I was living inside[N]
the skin of another being[Beat][AN][CF]

[ML][Wellington]
So is this your true self?[AN]
A traitor to Aeteria?[6N]
An upstart rebel's lapdog?[AN][CF]

[MR][Yufka]
My time in the council has[N]
given me much to ponder.[AN]
But now that I am here,[4N]
I feel closer to the truth.[AN]
I will be among those who[N]
pens this tale's closing act.[AN][CF]

[ML][Wellington]
Is that what you believe?[AN]
Then allow me to test[N]
your resolve[,] Minister.[AN][CF]

[X]

## RaialWulfricBossQ
[ML][Wellington]
So you must be the good[N]
Captain Raial.[AN]
I've heard much about you[N]
and your exploits.[AN][CF]

[MR][Raial]
Seems my reputation[N]
precedes me[,] eh?[AN]
I didn't realize I'd shaken[N]
up the roots that much.[AN][CF]

[ML][Wellington]
I pride myself in pursuing[N]
the truth of all matters.[AN]
I know the citizens speak of[N]
you with a quiet awe.[AN]
A brawler like a grizzly,[4N]
equally fierce as she is kind.[AN]
A woman who'd rather die[N]
than leave another behind.[AN][CF]

[MR][Raial]
And what of it?[AN]
That's just how I operate.[6N]
Do you take issue with it?[AN][CF]

[ML][Wellington]
No[,] as a matter of fact[,] I[N]
find it quite admirable.[AN]
In many ways[,] you are a[N]
paragon of sorts.[AN]
Perhaps[,] in another life,[N]
we could have fought under[AN]
the same banner[Beat][AN][CF]

[MR][Raial]
Don't you talk like that.[AN]
There's still a way out[N]
for you[,] General Wellington.[AN]
Think![.6] Is this truly the[N]
Aeterian future that you'd[AN]
always envisioned?[AN][CF]

[ML][Wellington]
[Beat]I cannot say[,] Ser.[6N]
I[Beat][AN][CF]

## MesselChiffonBossQ

[MR][Chiffon]
You're[Beat] General Messel![6N]
What are you doing here?![AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
How curious[,] I was about[N]
to ask you the same thing.[AN]
Last I'd checked[,] you were[N]
locked away in prison.[AN][CF]

[MR][Chiffon]
Messel[Beat] What compelled[N]
you to save my life?[AN]
To talk them down from[N]
executing me right there?[AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
When the Viper first[N]
brought you in,[AN]
he told me you were[N]
a threat to all of Aeteria.[AN]
It all sounded like drivel[N]
to my ears.[AN]
But seeing you in the[N]
fray with my own eyes[Beat][AN]
Perhaps there was a scrap[N]
of truth to his words.[AN][CF]

[MR][Chiffon]
A threat?[.6] I'm not here to[N]
tear down Aeteria[,] General.[AN]
I'm here to fix it.[6N]
Out of respect for what[N]
you've done for me,[AN]
I'll give you a chance[N]
to stand aside now.[AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
Hah![.6] You would ask me to[N]
abandon my duties?[AN]
You'd have more luck[N]
dousing a flame with[AN]
a handful of snow![AN]
Raise your weapon[,][N]
rebel leader![AN][CF]

[X]

## MesselGrahamBossQ
[ML][Messel]
Malcolm Graham.[AN]
I'd wondered where you'd[N]
ended up after the fiasco[AN]
with the court.[AN][CF]

[MR][Graham]
Did you truly think the[N]
Emperor's decree would[AN]
be enough to hold me down?[AN]
He is far from the first who's[N]
declared me a public enemy.[AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
A man as tenacious as you[N]
will always find a way[AN]
back on his feet.[AN]
I know far better than to[N]
underestimate a foe like you.[AN][CF]

[MR][Graham]
It matter not[,] Messel.[AN]
Something in Aeteria[N]
needs to change[Beat][AN]
And I will do whatever it[N]
takes to be that change.[AN][CF]
[X]

## MesselRaialBossQ
[MR][Raial]
General Messel![6N]
I salute you![AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
You are[Beat]?[AN][CF]

[MR][Raial]
I am Raial of Vintrus[,][N]
leader of the Resistance.[AN]
We've never met[,] but I've[N]
heard much about you.[AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
Tell me then[,] Raial.[6N]
What are your intentions?[AN]
What do you hope to gain[,][N]
stirring up trouble in Omios?[AN][CF]

[MR][Raial]
Order[,] General.[.6] Order.[6N]
Not Selwyn's twisted order,[AN]
but order for the people.[6N]
Order for the True Aeteria.[AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
Is that so[Beat][AN]
You don't seem like a bad[N]
sort to me[,] but that alone is[AN]
not enough for me to back[N]
down.[.6] En garde![AN]
[X]

## MesselVernaBossQ

[ML][Messel]
Lady Kyveli[Beat][AN]
I am truly sorry for how my[N]
colleagues have treated you.[AN][CF]

[MR][Verna]
[Beat][AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
I have tried to do what[N]
little I could to salvage[AN]
your reputation.[AN]
In truth[Beat] your magic is[N]
quite similar to mine.[AN]
It flows in a vein that is[N]
acutely familiar to me.[AN]
Regardless of what the[N]
Emperor has said of you[Beat][AN]
of what people believe[Beat][N]
Know that this is the truth.[AN][CF]

[MR][Verna]
Too little[,] too late.[AN]
I'm tired of being[N]
Aeteria's scapegoat.[AN]
It's about time I bit back[N]
at the emperor[,] eh?[AN][CF]

[X]

## MesselMooseBossQ

[ML][Messel]
Flynn?[.6] Flynn[,] is that you?[AN][CF]

[MR][Moose]
G-[.4]General Messel?![6N]
What are you doing here?![AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
I could say the same[,] lad![AN]
I haven't seen your mug[N]
since you pulled that stunt![AN]
Do you have any idea how[N]
many people almost lost[AN]
their lives because of you?[AN][CF]

[MR][Moose]
[Beat]Heh[,] I'd never forget[N]
that delight of a day.[AN]
Look[,] I know a chivalrous[N]
type like you'd never get it.[AN]
But I just wanted to make[N]
a difference[,] y'know?[AN][C]
Do something big.[AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
[Beat][AN][CF]

[MR][Moose]
As a messenger under[N]
yer banner,[AN]
I kept tellin' myself I was[N]
doing good in the world.[AN]
But never did it actually feel[N]
like what I did mattered.[AN]
I wanted more[Beat] so I left[N]
everything behind.[AN]
And I'll tell ya[,] livin' life[N]
as a freelancer[Beat][AN]
Gets the blood pumping[N]
like nothing else.[AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
I always did feel like you[N]
were a poor fit for service.[AN]
Despite everything[Beat][AN]
I'm thankful you found a[AN]
calling you truly love.[AN][CF]

[MR][Moose]
Love?[.6] Pfeh[,] we can say[N]
something like that.[AN]
Unfortunate it's led us to[N]
crossin' blades[,] though.[AN]
I know I was never a[N]
match for ya in training[Beat][AN]
but let's see if that's[N]
still the case now[,] eh?[AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
Very well.[.6] Russell Flynn,[4N]
I accept your challenge.[AN]
Come![.6] Do not hesitate![AN][CF]

## MesselStanielBossQ

[ML][Messel]
[Beat]A bard?[N]
What are you doing here?[AN][CF]

[ML][Staniel]
Ah[,] pardon me.[.6] I simply[N]
wish to watch history unfold.[AN]
Is it not thrilling[,] seeing a[N]
tale with your own two eyes?[AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
I[Beat] would not say so.[N]
Rather[,] a part of me is[AN]
mourning that this discord[N]
is happening to Aeteria in[AN]
my lifetime.[AN]
Now step away[,] bard.[.6] This[N]
is not your place.[AN][CF]

[ML][Staniel]
But without me[Beat] who will[N]
record this land's story?[AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
[Beat]I loathe to do this,[N]
but I did warn you.[AN][CF]

## MesselKianBossQ

[ML][Messel]
Sir Kian?[.6] I believe you are[N]
going the wrong way.[AN][CF]

[MR][Kian]
No[,] General Messel[Beat][AN]
This is the direction my[N]
heart is telling me to fly.[AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
Your orders were to contact[N]
Councilman Anton for aid[Beat][AN][C]
Why have you turned traitor?[AN][CF]

[MR][Kian]
I[Beat] I'm sorry[,] General.[AN]
You have been nothing but[N]
good to me[,] and yet I[Beat][AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
Do not falter[,] Kian.[AN]
I will not be angry as long as[N]
your convictions ring true.[AN][CF]

[MR][Kian]
They[Beat] They do[,] sir.[AN]
I believe[Beat] I know that what[N]
I'm doing is right.[AN][CF]

[ML][Messel]
Very well.[AN]
Then raise your lance[,] and[N]
prove it with your actions![AN][CF]
