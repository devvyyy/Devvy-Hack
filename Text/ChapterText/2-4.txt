[MR]
You're here on swift wings[,] General.[.6] Your[N]
esteem as our savior rings true.[AN]

I claim no such title.[.6] All I work towards is[N]

General Messel.[.6] It seems we are caught in[N]
an inciting game of cat and mouse with[N]
little end in sight.[AN]
The cultists of the Noctum Order and the[N]
soldiers of the Resistance form the[AN]
Aeterian Liberation army.[AN][C]
We cannot afford to underestimate such[n]
a manifold threat.[AN]

[ML]
I am not underestimating them.[.6] I am simply[Beat][N]
expressing my indignation.[.6] The army is[N]
stretched thin[,] Mala.[AN]
We stick our nose to the grindstone.[6N]
The Emperor says "Excellent[Beat]" and leaves[N]
it at that.[AN]

[FR]
We are generals of the empire[,] bound to[N]
our duty to fulfill His Grace's orders[,][N]
are we not?[AN]
Yet we waver in our convictions[Beat][N]
What kind of example are we setting[N]
for our allies?[.6] Our people?[AN]

[ML]
Pah[,] what is this nonsense?[.6] We didn't [OpenQuote]waver"[N]
until the woefully unprepared Duke took[N]
control of Aeteria.[AN][C]
Because of him[,] the Imperial army's reputation[N]
will be sent to the wastes.[AN]

[FR]
General[,] inform the soldiers to close the gates[N]
of Omios.[.6] Under no circumstance can we[N]
allow the rebels to leave the city.[AN]
Fortify Omios![.6] Leave no gate unclosed![AN]
General Wulfric and I will trail the rebels.[6N]
We shall corner and capture them before[N]
bringing them to Sele.[AN]

[ML]
Capture the rebels[Beat]? The Emperor said not[N]
of taking prisoners[,] General.[AN]

[FR]
General Messel[,] I believe we are at a point[N]
where we cannot simply abide by every[N]
one of His Majesty's foolish orders.[AN]

[ML]
I'll put my faith in you[,] General.[.6][N]
But do not misplace my trust.[.6][N]
I will head to the city gates at once.[AN]

Look over there[Beat] Are we ready?[AN]

[FL][Raial]
There's already a brawl happening in all the[N]
fracas.[.6] If you want to show me what you're[N]
capable of[,] now's the time.[an][C]
Let's get in there![AN]

[R][Verna]
Looks like there's no direct way out of the[N]
city:[.4] the gate is locked.[AN]

[FR][Jaye]
When has a little gate stopped us before?[AN][ClearFace]

[FR][Graham]
There is no turning back now.[.6] We are strong[N]
enough to pull through[,] no matter the odds.[AN]

[FL]
Who said anything about turning back?[6N]
We're going to break through those gates[N]
and tear 'em down![AN]

[Pause]Did we think of this?[AN]

Cease your fretting[,] Ser.[.6] That building[N]
is the control room.[.6] We can remotely[N]
open the gate through the building.[AN]

[R]
Then that'll be our ticket outta Omios.[.6][N]
Come on![AN]

[FR]
It looks like General Messel is leading their[N]
forces.[.6] Lead us well[,] Chiffon[,] or we will[N]
be caught in a relentless pursuit.[AN]

There's flagbearers among the enemy forces.[AN]

[R][Graham]
I suggest we take care of the empire's[N]
messengers before they find the[N]
chance to flee.[AN]

[FR][Raial]
Killing innocent forces like that doesn't[N]
stick right with me.[.6] I'm sure the [ToggleRed]Generals[N]
wouldn't be quite happy either[ToggleRed].[AN]

[R]
They are not innocent[,] Captain;[.4][N]
they[,] too[,] are soldiers of the empire.[.6][N]
Death is something one takes for granted.[AN]
If we show mercy now[,] the tides will[N]
surely turn against us[,] in one[N]
way or another.[AN]
We can't let them [ToggleRed]alert reinforcements[ToggleRed].[6N]
Shoot them all down[,] leader.[6N]
Without hesitation.[AN]

[FL][Maynard][L][Eustace]

[FL]
My Emperor[Beat] Might I inquire as to the purpose[N]
of such a abrupt summon?[.6] We haven't heard[N]
from you in a while.[AN]

[L]
A few moons longer and I've thought you met[N]
the same fate as--[AN]

[FFR]
Allow me to extend my gratitude to you[N]
Consuls.[.6] Oblige me;[.4] pray tell the status of[N]
each of the kingdom's territories.[AN]

[FL]
It is nothing but satisfactory[,] my Emperor.[.6][N]
The north is bountiful.[.6] For what it lacks in[N]
soil[,] they offer in precious ore.[AN]

[L]
The knights of Wreyvine have little power in[N]
the matter.[.6] They scattered like mice.[6N]
I say your reign is absolute[,] My Emperor.[AN]

[FFR]
[Pause][AN]

[L]
My Emperor?[AN]

[FFR]
[Pause][AN]

[FL]
Selwyn[,] plea--[AN]

[FFR]
Silence.[.6] You address the Emperor of Aeteria.[6N]
Do not presume you can speak so freely[N]
in my presence.[AN]

[L]
[Beat]Understood[,] my Emperor.[AN]

[FFR]
It has come to my attention that a man[N]
in the kingdom is on a lone quest to ignite[N]
the flames of rebellion.[AN]

[FL]
But[Beat] How could a single man hope to[N]
accomplish such a feat?[.6] Are we given[N]
a name?[.6] Anything to identify him?[AN] 

[FFR]
We have no information on his identity.[6N]
But it only takes the smallest of sparks[N]
to light the grandest of fires.[AN]

[L]
[Beat][AN]

[FFR]
See to it that the opposition is crushed[N]
underfoot.[.6] Do not shirk your duties.[.6][N]
Proceed with due deliberation.[AN]

[MR]
How irresponsible I am[,] letting the rebels escape[N]
the city.[.6] My sincere apologies[,] Opali.[AN]

[L]
General[,] do not slight yourself.[.6][N]
The city remains under control[,] and there[N]
is always more work to do.[an]

[MR]
I could've had this done[Beat][.6][N]
The rebels were all within reach[Beat][N]
But none were captured today.[AN]

[FL]
The Messel I knew was merciful to a fault.[6N]
Do not forsake that quality over a petty[N]
band of rebels.[AN]

[MR]
And I thought you pursued answers[,] General.[.6][N]
You told me these rebels are dangerous.[.6][N]
I must rectify my mistake and pursue them.[AN]
You two[,] please rest easy.[.6] I know the[N]
uprising has been difficult[,] but it will[N]
be over soon.[AN][CF]

[FFR][Soldier2][MMR]
I[Beat][.6] I bring a report from Major Hayes![.6][N]
General Opali.[.6] General Wellington.[.6] You two[N]
have been given new orders from the Emperor.[AN][Event]

[L]
[Beat]Continue.[.6] This cannot be good.[AN]

[MR]
It concerns Count Locro.[.6] Given that the rebels[N]
are headed towards the border[,] he requests[N]
personal bodyguards at his side.[AN]

[FL]
Excellent.[.6] I signed up as General to be a cover for[N]
human filth.[.6] That vain noble does nothing all[N]
day at his guard booth at the empire's edge[Beat][AN]

[L]
We do not have a choice in the matter[,] Wulfric.[.6][N]
Thank you[,] Ser.[.6] You may report back at once.[AN]

[MR]
Yes[,] General.[.6] May moonlight guide us.
[MR][CF]
[FL][CF][MR][LoadWellington]

[L][MoveMidLeft]

[MR]
How irritating[Beat] The count spends his time on[N]
authorizing grand spectacles of himself.[.6] He[N]
belives he's the first at risk?[AN]

[ML]
We accept his 'offer'[,] and will head towards[N]
the border and defend him.[.6] There is no[N]
other way.[AN]

Such mystical tunes[Beat] Yet I've never even[N]
heard of one quite like you.[AN]

[MR][OpenEyes]
Here[,] my name is Staniel.[.6] But I am[N]
but a traveling bard.[.6] Nothing more.[AN]

[FFL]
A wayward bard must've seen all sorts of[N]
places.[.6] Didya find your way in the kingdom[N]
while the Emperor gave 'em a thrashing?[AN]

[MR]
Yes[,] in fact[Beat] Such dreadful sights.[6N]
Royal knights[,] fallen and still.[.6] The[N]
rest[,] chasing scattered leaves.[AN]
Yet the moon does not waver.[6N]
The battered lands of Ideon cry for change[,][N]
who who will step forward?[AN]

[FFL]
Play again[,] brother![.6] Another song![AN]

[MR]
I fear my time here will be short-lived[Beat][N]
But alright.[.6] Allow our souls to[N]
beat as one.[AN]
