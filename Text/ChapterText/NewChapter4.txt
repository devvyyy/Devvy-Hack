[Beat][AN]

[MR]
[Mouth](There's nothing left here... We have[N]
to head to the border before the[N]
Aeterians break through.)[AN][Clear][Mouth]
[Pause]Sir.[.6] The Captain and the others[N]
are already on their way.[AN]

[ML]
Stop.[.6] Please stop.[.6] We failed in our mission.[6N]
We were supposed to protect Northelm[Beat][N]
Now[,] look.[.6] It's piles of ash![AN]

[MR]
We did all we could do.[.6] If you want[,] I[N]
could survey the village.[.6] There may still[N]
be more stragglers.[AN]

[ML]
No[,] you're right.[.6] We must move on and[N]
leave everything behind.[AN]

[MR]
I didn't say that.[AN]

[ML]
I know what you meant.[.6] You're methodical.[.6][N]
Your gaze is always[Beat] unnerving[,] fixed[N]
ever onward.[.6] You know what you want.[AN]

[MR]
Sir.[AN][Event]

[ML]
My apologies[Beat] It's just[Beat] I've seen this[N]
before.[.6] Homes torched[,] civilians alight.[6N]
I thought I'd never see this sight again.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[ML]
When the flames face me again[,] how will[N]
we stand up from losses like these?[6N]
How can we even hope to win this war[Beat]?[AN]

[MR]
We'll continue to do what we can do.[6N]
This is only the beginning of the war.[AN]

[ML]
Do you still doubt the power of the[N]
Aeterian empire[,] Affogato?![.6] Even as[N]
you watch the flames and melting snow?[AN]
They don't burn you at the stake[,] they[N]
cremate the entirety of village until the[N]
soil is naught but ashes![AN]

[MR]
I've never doubted the empire[,] no.[.6][N]
But this fear of yours is only going[N]
to get you killed.[AN]
Look around you: ignited wood[,] scorched[N]
earth amidst the dead[,] buried by heaps[N]
of singed stone.[AN]
We need to focus on the *now*[,] Sir[,][N]
which is surviving the Aeterian invasion[N]
with the most troops intact.[AN]
We can move onto reconstruction after we[N]
make sure Wreyvine makes it out of this[N]
war unbroken.[AN]

[ML]
[Beat][AN]

[MR]
I'm sorry[,] but we'll all die if we fall[N]
into Aeteria's trap.[.6] We all trust you to[N]
lead us to survival.[AN]

[ML]
I can't think[Beat] I just don't understand[N]
why they chose to stall us at the capital[N]
if they wanted to assassinate the King.[AN]

[MR]
[Mouth](Right, that doesn't make any sense.[N]
How is the Imperial army able to be almost[N]
everywhere at once?)[AN]
(If they're aiming to kill the King, then[N]
it'd surely be wiser to concentrate their[N]
forces rather than splitting up.)[AN]
(Yet we haven't gotten a report from[N]
Castle Wreyvine... Their tactics don't seem to[N]
make any sort of sense[,] but...)[AN][Mouth]

[ML]
Affogato?[.6] Did you--[AN]

[MR]
Let's go[,] Sir.[.6] People are waiting.[6N]
It should be a long but uneventful trek[N]
from here to the city border.[AN]

[ML]
No[Beat] Wait.[.6] Just one more thing.[6N]
I've been turning it over in my head--[.6]
what you said before.[.6] About the now.[AN]
We don't win this war by pushing like an[N]
elk with its head cut off.[.6] We win by[N]
directly cutting the roots.[AN]

[MR]
Sir?[AN]

[ML]
The Duke will soon be in the capital plaza.[.6][N]
Not just commanding from afar[Beat] He's there.[6N]
At the rally tomorrow.[AN]
After burning our city[,] he fully[N]
deserves to have a knife in his heart.[6N]
I know it's a tall order[,] Affogato[Beat][AN]
But if he lives[,] this city will burn.[6N]
And the next[Beat] And the next[Beat][N]
until Wreyvine is fully aflame.[AN][C]
We lost Northelm,[.4] and we failed here.[6N]
But maybe we still have one chance.[AN]

[MR]
Then give me the order.[AN]

[ML]
I already have.[.6] Duke Selwyn must fall![6N]
One act that might slow this madness[N]
before it all spirals past us![AN]
