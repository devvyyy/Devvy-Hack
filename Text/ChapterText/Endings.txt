## AffogatoSoloEnding
Apsiel vanished into the abyss, taking[N]
the Primordial One with him. His legacy[N]
was a conflicted one of many eras and[N]
countries, but there was one truth:[N]
he died peacefully, content.[X]

## UlrichSoloEnding
Ulrich abandoned his name and armor after[N]
the Emperor's War, choosing to live as[N]
a humble tutor. It was his many allies[N]
and friends who allowed him to relieve[N]
what haunted him and live happily.[X]

## BreveSoloEnding
Breve returned to Hera and worked[N]
tirelessly towards his hidden passions,[N]
trading steel for yeast. His bread[N]
became famous across the bridge, each[N]
loaf a rebellion against his family.[X]

## HildrSoloEnding
Though the world forgot most of the[N]
war, [OpenQuote]Hildr" was shouted across taverns,[N]
training halls, and bard songs with a[N]
legendary persistence. She retired bored[N]
and undefeated, ready to defy fate.[X]

## AnsgarSoloEnding
Ansgar returned to Hera, ready to never[N]
fight a battle again. His children say[N]
they've never seen him smile wider than[N]
when he melted his old weapons to forge[N]
a simple horseshoe.[X]

## SequinSoloEnding
Sequin vanished into the snow with[N]
a book and an Imperial staff he stole.[N]
He returned years later amidst the[N]
ashes of Yelia with a shovel and a[N]
construction crew.[X]

## NoraSoloEnding
Nora rose to the top of the church[N]
as a saint, honoring her family's name.[N]
She traveled the world, healing the[N]
sick, mentoring the lost, and was[N]
soon known as a savior.[X]

## KaneSoloEnding
Kane moved to the empire after the war,[N]
reopening his tavern. Though his[N]
family seldom visited, his patrons[N]
said his smile came easier, especially[N]
when pouring a double.[X]

## MochaSoloEnding
Mocha was free to enjoy life as she pleased,[N]
now without the chains that shackled her.[N]
She traveled the world, made many friends[N]
across Ideon, and was known throughout[N]
as a bit of a herald for peace.[X]

## LevainSoloEnding
Levain returned to Valland not as a[N]
soldier, but as a hunter. They lived[N]
a satisfying, quiet life, free from[N]
strife and the horrors of the war[N]
they sought to avoid.[X]

## StroganoffSoloEnding
Stroganoff resurfaced only in taverns and[N]
training yards. He never fully kicked the[N]
drink, but some say he started healing[N]
when he began to train war orphans,[N]
hungover or not.[X]

## EisnerSoloEnding
Eisner returned to the cliffs of the north[N]
with his trusty griffon. His visits back[N]
to the capital were oft short, but he[N]
always left with a bag full of seeds[N]
and an armful of spite.[X]

## DoppioSoloEnding
Doppio laid down her arms and returned[N]
quietly to Solas, where she was wed to[N]
an Imperial knight. The two opened a home[N]
near the bridge, and their children[N]
never knew the scars of battle.[X]

## FlorisSoloEnding
As illness slowly took him, Floris wrote[N]
a memoir before peacefully passing in a[N]
crisp, spring morning. His last sermon[N]
ended with a chuckle, [OpenQuote]Bernhardt, you[N]
saved me a good seat, right?"[X]

## YorySoloEnding
Yory made it to royal engineer twice:[N]
first, he was fired for being a jackass.[N]
The second time, he spent an entire[N]
decade redesigning the Bridge; nobody[N]
could deny it looked nice.[X]

## NoelSoloEnding
Though she once chased vengeance, Noel lived[N]
a warden's life after the war, patrolling[N]
border villages and protecting citizens[N]
of both halves of Ideon without question[N]
or pause. She was happy to protect.[X]

## BrudetSoloEnding
Brudet took command of the united aerial[N]
knights and trained a generation who could[N]
dodge storms and arrows alike. Her[N]
legendary reputation struck both awe[N]
and fear in all of her squires.[X]

## ThereseSoloEnding
Therese never rested, immediately rising[N]
as one of Wreyvine's finest knights.[N]
After the war, she rebuilt her House's[N]
training grounds into a school for[N]
squires of any station to strive.[X]

## LennardSoloEnding
Lennard vanished just two months after[N]
the war, leaving only a note that said,[N]
[OpenQuote]Nobles. Gone fishing. Bye." Rumors say he[N]
retired to the mountains with a dog and[N]
enough coin to live a quiet life.[X]

## WegmanSoloEnding
Wegman retired to a warm home and yet a[N]
louder one, where he trained recruits and[N]
his son--Oswald never stopped sparring[N]
him with sticks, and Wegman never stopped[N]
letting him win.[X]

## KlavdiaSoloEnding
Klavdia wept beside former enemies as she[N]
gently laid her axe upon a memorial[N]
she helped build. She looked toward[N]
the future her children and husband[N]
would never see with open eyes.[X]

## GerolfSoloEnding
After the war, Gerolf took up a chalkboard[N]
instead of a blade in a knight academy,[N]
tutoring the nobility and commoners alike[N]
with the same one-eyed ferocity and wit[N]
he displayed in the war.[X]

## XavierSoloEnding
Xavier retired in a very loose sense, given[N]
his love of peril, and then crashed into[N]
yet another marriage before promptly[N]
vanishing again. He left 4 (or perhaps 7?)[N]
families in his wake.[X]

## OgrimSoloEnding
Ogrim organized a lantern-lit vigil across[N]
the Bridge each year, his gaze unshaking[N]
and quiet. He never fully forgave himself,[N]
but he lit fewer candles every year[N]
and the weight began to lift...[X]

## IrisSoloEnding
Iris opened a font of learning in the[N]
kingdom, preaching peace amidst despair[N]
through the Hearthbringer's teachings.[N]
In a few decades, magic was seen less[N]
under scrutiny, but as a tool.[X]

## ChiffonSoloEnding
Though once a bastard, barmaid, and rebel,[N]
Empress Sylmeria carved unity from blood[N]
and ice. Her efforts never wavered, slowly[N]
shaping the United Kingdom of Ideon into[N]
a new dawn--an era of prosperity.[X]

## GrahamSoloEnding
Though offered titles, Graham vanished[N]
before the coronation, deciding to[N]
dedicate himself to serving the Empress[N]
alone while conducting [OpenQuote]business"[N]
for the Order on the side.[X]

## YufkaSoloEnding
Yufka published her war journal, and it was[N]
sold out within days in several provinces[N]
across Ideon. She continued to serve the Order,[N]
but those who met her said her eyes had[N]
seen past the world entirely.[X]

## JayeSoloEnding
Lightning never strikes twice, but Jaye[N]
proved to be an exception. After the war,[N]
Jaye returned to the rebuilt academy[N]
and... blew the roof off of 3 rooms.[N]
She was still tenured.[X]

## PennySoloEnding
After unraveling the mystery behind[N]
Lord Mariya's death, Penny reclaimed her[N]
ruined house with a sigh. Whenever[N]
anybody asked, she said that it simply[N]
wasn't worth talking about.[X]

## YvonneSoloEnding
With the truth finally laid bare, Yvonne[N]
inherited the Governor's old chair and[N]
his ledger, making sure nobody in the[N]
New Order would ever suffer a fate[N]
like that again.[X]

## VernaSoloEnding
With the Empress' support, Verna reclaimed[N]
the fallen house Kyveli's estate and[N]
honor. Though no court ever offered her[N]
an apology, she didn't care; she went[N]
around the world, mending souls.[X]

## FryeSoloEnding
After laying down his blade, Frye opened[N]
a tavern where the meat always came[N]
with an effortless show--igniting blades[N]
mid-spin, flaming skewers, toasting sweets.[N]
Patrons loved the fiery coin most.[X]

## VeliusSoloEnding
Velius built a small temple in the north[N]
where acolytes could hone their ether.[N]
He never raised his voice, but when he[N]
spoke of the dead, everybody, even the[N]
New Governor would listen.[X]

## CortadoSoloEnding
Cortado only briefly revisited her birthland,[N]
and ended up finding a quiet strength in[N]
refusing to pick a side. She became one of[N]
the Empress' most trusted vassals across[N]
the bridge, now sure of who she is.[X]

## GusSoloEnding
Gus completely vanished with no trace.[N]
He did NOT fund orphanages or relief[N]
for the victims of the war. He did NOT[N]
buy an entire village he once robbed[N]
to pay it back. He did NOT![X]

## RaialSoloEnding
Raial retired undefeated, feared, and[N]
adored, though she did punch a noble for[N]
calling the Empress a 'bastard'. She[N]
declined every medal they offered,[N]
and tore down all of her statues.[X]

## IlseSoloEnding
Ilse left behind her mercenary days without[N]
ceremony, taking only her bow and her captain's[N]
last words. Years later, she began to start[N]
her own mercenary company. Her proteges swore[N]
her eyes were gentler than her aim.[X]

## PandoroSoloEnding
When peace came, Pandoro returned to the[N]
mountains of the south. He built shrines[N]
from bone and antler for the Serpent who[N]
guided his wrath. No one dared disturb[N]
him, and after, he was calm, always.[X]

## RinaSoloEnding
Rina's win streak never broke, though her[N]
rivals dwindled until only tavern brawls[N]
and arenas remained. Eventually, she finally[N]
lost on purpose to a village girl with[N]
a stick. She said she was proud.[X]

## StanielSoloEnding
Staniel didn't vanish after the war, but[N]
his appearances were brief and only around[N]
snowy taverns and inns. Rumors spread of[N]
the strange minstrel who played the[N]
saddest songs with a smile on his face.[X]

## DiraSoloEnding
Nobody's certain how Dira came to work for[N]
the Imperial army, but she turned her[N]
blades inward, choosing instead to[N]
guard the forgotten and the weak. Though[N]
old habits die hard in dark alleys...[X]

## EdithSoloEnding
Edith retired to a quiet abbey near the capital.[N]
Her last pupil, the Empress, never missed a[N]
single lesson. At her funeral, old students[N]
wept openly, and not one of them ever[N]
called her [OpenQuote]General" again.[X]

## MooseSoloEnding
They said the man who called himself [OpenQuote]Moose"[N]
was reckless, untouchable, and untamed.[N]
Only the Empress knew he once failed to save[N]
his closest ally, and every near-death stunt[N]
was him trying to give his own life back.[X]

## ChesterSoloEnding
Under the watch of the Exemplar herself,[N]
Chester tempered his wildness into wisdom,[N]
his arrow finally flying where it should.[N]
He later led the Imperial Rangers with[N]
equal honestly and laughter.[X]

## KianSoloEnding
Kian vanished after the war, choosing no[N]
glory, no reward, only destinations others[N]
feared to reach. The wounded always claimed[N]
there was a savior in the storm who[N]
rescued them from wind and beast alike.[X]

## EdvinSoloEnding
Edvin took the crumbling Imperial court[N]
and dragged it to the public eye,[N]
stripping it of its many secrets and[N]
attempting a rather fiery reform.[N]
He was satisfied by the result.[X]

## OpaliSoloEnding
When Opali died, no horns sound, no banners[N]
were flown. But a hundred commanders from[N]
each kingdom knelt at sunrise for the[N]
General who taught them when to lower[N]
their blades and bolden their hearts.[X]

## WulfricSoloEnding
They called Wulfric [OpenQuote]Professor," [OpenQuote]Master," even [OpenQuote]Father,"[N]
but never by the names he longed to hear again.[N]
He never missed a graduation, and in his[N]
will, he left every medal to students who[N]
didn't survive long enough to earn one.[X]

## MesselSoloEnding
They built a statue for Messel in Omios.[N]
When the fire broke out at the orphanage,[N]
he was already inside, carrying a child[N]
in each arm. He left no heir, no memoir,[N]
yet an eternal legacy nonetheless.[X]

## BreveHildrEnding
# paired endings start here
Breve opened his famous bakery just a stone's[N]
throw from the 7th Platoon's first battle.[N]
Hildr became his most frequent visitor[N]
sometimes for the rye, more often to[N]
correct his posture with a wooden axe.[X]

## AffogatoAnsgarEnding
Every spring, Ansgar hung a wreath over[N]
his forge's mantle. He never told his[N]
children who it honored, only that it belonged[N]
to the most reliable man he ever saw[N]
smile at the end.[X]

## UlrichHildrEnding
Hildr sparred her old commander every winter[N]
morning without fail, her strikes sharper[N]
than ever, though Ulrich held his own.[N]
She still called him [OpenQuote]Lieutenant" like[N]
always, but now it was with a smirk.[X]

## UlrichOgrimEnding
When Ogrim learned the truth, he didn't flinch,[N]
only handed Ulrich a candle and said,[N]
[OpenQuote]One extra this year, then..."[N]
They lit it together, and for the first time[N]
in decades, Ogrim called him by [OpenQuote]Otto".[X]

## UlrichOpaliEnding
At Opali's nationwide funeral, Ulrich stood[N]
alone until the last bell, head bowed in[N]
peace and grief. His old vengeance died years[N]
before... buried under the weight of a hand[N]
Opali had once offered first.[X]

## UlrichWegmanEnding
They met weekly to talk about Lieutenant Ulrich,[N]
sometimes to mourn, sometimes to laugh, sometimes[N]
to lie a little less. It never got easier, but[N]
Otto never stopped coming, and Wegman never[N]
stopped leaving the door unlocked.[X]

## SequinNoraEnding
While Nora healed the wounded across Ideon,[N]
she quietly funneled funds to an anonymous[N]
builder reconstructing the ruins of Yelia.[N]
Half shrine, half home, and fully the work[N]
of two old friends who never gave up.[X]

## NoraFlorisEnding
Nora delivered her uncle's last rites[N]
beneath a budding tree in spring, his memoir[N]
tucked beneath her arm. She read the last[N]
line: [OpenQuote]If he could see her now,[N]
Bernhardt would weep. So I'll weep for him."[X]

## AnsgarBreveEnding
After the war, Ansgar forged blades, Breve[N]
baked bread, and between them stood a tiny[N]
stall that sold both. The laughing blacksmith[N]
covered with flour and the grumbling baker[N]
was a potent combo for Hera.[X]

## AnsgarWegmanEnding
Their training yard became infamous for bad[N]
jokes and worse swordplay. While their sons[N]
sparred, Ansgar and Wegman laughed themselves[N]
hoarse at the same tired jokes, claiming[N]
every groan meant they'd landed a hit.[X]

## AnsgarKaneEnding
Ansgar and Kane grew inseparable after the[N]
war, with one pouring drinks, the other supplying[N]
the steel taps. They rebuilt their tavern-home[N]
together, each swing of the hammer and mug[N]
a small act of reclaimed brotherhood.[X]

## StroganoffBrudetEnding
Though Brudet led her knights with precision,[N]
it was Stroganoff's crooked wisdom, delivered[N]
through slurred metaphors and surprise parries[N]
that stuck with her squires. She never admitted[N]
it, but he wasn't... a *terrible* teacher.[X]

## WegmanStroganoffEnding
Wegman's door was always open, and eventually[N]
Stroganoff stopped pretending he didn't[N]
know the way. Still, when Oswald fell sick one[N]
year, it was Stroganoff who showed up at[N]
the door: clean-shaven, flaskless, and early.[X]

## DoppioStroganoffEnding
Doppio's home near the bridge became Stroganoff's[N]
favorite place to sober up--briefly, and[N]
very briefly at that. Despite this, they[N]
all listened closely when he mumbled[N]
old battlefield wisdom between hiccups.[X]

## ThereseStroganoffEnding
When Therese's school opened its doors[N]
for all, Stroganoff was the first to stumble[N]
through them; uninvited, beer in hand,[N]
shouting corrections at drills. Somehow,[N]
he ended up on staff, working overtime.[X]

## BrudetNoelEnding
Captain Brudet's standards were fierce,[N]
but Noel never flinched, earning her mentor's[N]
nod with every village and civilian rescued.[N]
Years later, when Brudet's wyvern passed,[N]
it was Noel who stood beside her.[X]

## BrudetMochaEnding
Mocha flew farther than any of Brudet's recruits,[N]
and when she returned, it was always to[N]
the same balcony, where Brudet waited for[N]
her with tea, stories, and the same stern[N]
gaze softened only for her.[X]

## BrudetEisnerEnding
Eisner often returned unannounced, his griffon[N]
clashing beak-first with Brudet's wyvern in[N]
playful midair duels. They never spoke much--[N]
he saluted, she scoffed--but every student[N]
knew the look she gave him was golden.[X]

## BrudetFlorisEnding
After Floris' passing, Brudet grounded herself[N]
for the first time in decades, spending each[N]
spring morning rereading his memoir by[N]
candlelight. She never spoke of grief,[N]
only trained harder and steadier.[X]

## RaialFlorisEnding
Despite her renown and fame as a[N]
war hero and legend, Raial escorted[N]
Floris to see the ocean before his[N]
illness took him. She visited his[N]
grave every year with two cups.[X]

## RaialIlseEnding
Raial left command, but not Ilse.[N]
Together, they wandered to the north.[N]
Years later, their shared legend formed[N]
a guild: bold, blunt, a company loyal to[N]
none but each other.[X]

## ChiffonRaialEnding
Empress Sylmeria carved unity from blood[N]
and ice with her left-hand, Raial.[N]
Their efforts never wavered, slowly[N]
shaping the United Kingdom of Ideon into[N]
a new dawn--an era of prosperity.[X]

## ChiffonGrahamEnding
Empress Sylmeria carved unity from blood[N]
and ice with her right-hand, Graham.[N]
Their efforts never wavered, slowly[N]
shaping the United Kingdom of Ideon into[N]
a new dawn--an era of prosperity.[X]

## YufkaVernaEnding
Yufka founded the Order, but it was[N]
Verna who gave it a heart. People whispered[N]
that together, they made the impossible:[N]
miraculous healing beyond all visions[N]
as mentor and mender.[X]

## YufkaPennyEnding
Some say Penny replaced her father.[N]
Others say she buried him twice: once with[N]
her own hands, and once with Yufka's blessing.[N]
Either way, she and Yufka became something[N]
colder than loyalty and warmer than fear.[X]

## YufkaDiraEnding
Yufka never needed a bodyguard, but she let[N]
Dira follow anyway. People whispered it was[N]
out of guilt; others said love. Either way,[N]
those who crossed the new Noctum Order[N]
never did so twice.[X]

## FryeRinaEnding
Legends claim the siblings burned down their[N]
very first tavern, where winners got free[N]
dinner. Challengers came to test Rina's[N]
sword skills, and left with Frye's meals[N]
melting on their tongue, full price.[X]

## GrahamYvonneEnding
While Yvonne, as the new Governor, rooted out[N]
corruption in the Order, Graham quietly cleaned[N]
up the rest, serving as Reverend and Empress'[N]
right-hand. When the leaders shared drinks, they[N]
both always toasted to the former Governor first.[X]

## PennyYvonneEnding
The sisters rebuilt their House with the blessing[N]
of the Empress. Yvonne was the new Order's Governor,[N]
while Penny handled logistics. They never spoke[N]
of what they found together in the Governor's[N]
ledger, but they never disagreed again.[X]

## WulfricOgrimEnding
placeholder
[X]

## JayeSequinEnding
Yelia became the first academy to teach[N]
Kingdom-born mages, rebuilt by Sequin's[N]
quiet hands and scorched yearly by[N]
Jaye's [OpenQuote]demonstrations." Somehow, the roof of this font[N]
of learning kept getting fixed.[X]
