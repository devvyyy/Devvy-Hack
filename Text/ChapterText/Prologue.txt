Sir,[.4] the bakery was ransacked[N]
by brigands![AN]
Without the food supply,[.4] we may not[N]
have enough food to last the winter.[AN]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]That is troubling,[.4][OpenEyes] but I'm not sure[N]
if we could do much about it.[AN]

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadAffo][MFL2][0x50]

[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadAffo]
[OpenFarLeft]Well,[.4] we have to do something.[.6][N]
Why not take it back?[AN]

[OpenLeft]I was worried you would[N]
say that[Beat][AN]
Look,[.4] I'm a knight,[.4] not some[N]
raider.[AN]
I can't just frolic around[N]
and kill people for bread.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure the king wouldn't[N]
mind a quick excursion.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Come on,[.4] I'll rally the[N]
others.[.6][AN]

[OpenRight]Thank you![.6] They departed[N]
for the ruins next to the sea.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Urgh,[.4] alright[Beat][.6] What are we[N]
even going to do?[AN]
Walk up to the entrance and ask,[N]
"Hello,[.4] we'd like our bread back."?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]
I got a better idea,[.4] but you'll[N]
have to back me up.[A][ToggleSmile][X]

[OpenMidRight]Affogato,[.4] didn't you say these[N]
were brigands?[.6] Why in the world[N]
do they use elder magic?[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[OpenMidLeft]I wasn't expecting shamans[N]
either.[AN]
Few can resist magic in this[N]
world,[AN]
[ToggleSmile]but I'd like to think I'd[N]
fare better than most.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not that it matters,[.4]
you're an archer.[AN]

you want later.[.6] After we[N]
all get out alive.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I know that.[.6][ToggleSmile] I'm more[N]
concerned over who,[.4] or rather,[.4][N]
what exactly we're fighting.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]These shamans weren't here[N]
until recently.[.6] This doesn't bode[N]
well for the capital.[AN]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
[OpenMidLeft]Peculiar,[.4] isn't it?[.6] Even so,[.4][N]
I don't think it's our problem.[AN]
The capital has a division of light[N]
mages,[.4] for heck's sake.[A][X]
