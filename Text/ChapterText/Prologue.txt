# Wreyvians and Aeterians
The twin kingdoms of[N]
Wreyvine and Aeteria.[A][2NL]
A creator's kingdom of genesis.[.6][N]
An eternal kingdom of oblivion.[A][2NL]
Together they make up the[N]
continent of Ideon.[A][2NL]
The balance is held by two[N]
constants-[.4] the twin deities[N]
of Wreyvine and Aeteria.[A][2NL]
A pale bird perched atop the Hallowed One...[.6][N]
A black horse saddled by the Ashen Rider.[A][2NL]
The sun rises upon the Wreyvians,[.4] as[N]
the moon sets upon the Aeterians.[A][2NL]

## AmongUsEdgyIntro2
Yet on this day,[.4] amidst Ideon's howling[N]
winter of year 643,[.4] the wary balance of[N]
Wreyvine and Aeteria begins to shift...[A][X]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadHildr]
[OpenMidRight]Alright, everyone,[.4] listen up.[.6] The King[N]
has tasked us with securing nearby ruins.[AN]
Apparently,[.4] it used to be a[N]
Wreyvian stronghold[Beat][AN]
[Pause]Not that you can really[N]
tell nowadays.[AN]
It's not really in the best condition,[.4][N]
so we have to make sure[AN]
there's no trouble brewing[N]
or anything like that.[AN]
[OpenLeft]Yeah,[.4] yeah.[.6] Should be[N]
easy enough.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Wow,[.4] overconfident as[N]
ever,[.4] Breve![AN][ToggleSmile]
[OpenLeft][OpenQuote]Overconfident"?[.6] Hildr,[.4] [ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]I prefer[N]
the term [OpenQuote]right".[ToggleSmile][AN][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidRight]We don't know what lurks[N]
in there.[.6] We should be careful.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
It's just ruins,[.4] yeah?[.6] Probably brigands[N]
or something similar.[AN]
Whatever it is,[.4] it's nothing our[N]
platoon hasn't faced before.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
What if there's ghosts or something?[.6][N]
[MoveFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Oooooooooh[Beat]![AN][ToggleSmile]

[OpenLeft][CloseEyes][Beat]Stop.[AN][OpenEyes]

[OpenMidRight]It's a small mission[N]

unusual there[Beat][AN]

[OpenRight]Not just the rookie.[.6][N]
Ansgar![.6] You're late,[.4] too![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]You know how heavy this[N]
darned armor is,[.4] eh?[AN]
Bettin' ya anyone else would crumble[N]
tryin' to wear this.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile][MoveFarRight]Well,[.4] I'm glad everyone's here![.6][N]
Today's gonna be another good day![AN]
Sun's shining out there,[.4] it's a[N]

[OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
Affogato.[.6] Ansgar.[.6] His Majesty has[N]
trusted us with a mission.[AN]
I'd prefer if we didn't waste[N]
any more time.[AN]
Come on,[.4] now![.6] Let us begin[N]
the march,[.4] everyone.[A][X]

## Prologue2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBreve][OpenLeft][LoadHildr]
[OpenLeft][Pause]Are you sure this is the[N]
right place?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]No other place in Wreyvine[N]
like it,[.4] I'd reckon.[AN]
[OpenLeft]I don't like the[N]
air of this place.[AN]
[OpenRight][LoadAnsgarLeft][OpenFarRight][LoadAnsgarRight]
[OpenRight]We'll be fine.[.6] Stand by me,[.4][N]
and this'll be over quick.[AN]
The other recruits are waitin'[N]

We all know that Sequin and Nora can't[N]
sit still without us for seven minutes.[AN]

[OpenLeft][LoadHildr][MoveLeft]
[OpenLeft]Hey,[.4] you![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.4]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Hold on.[.6] Are you knights[N]

Did the Queen send you?[.6][N]

[OpenRight][LoadMarc]
Hrm?[.6] You all are[Beat][N]
knights of Wreyvine.[AN]
And you[Beat] You're the leader[N]
of this band?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
You'd do well to explain what your[N]
intentions here are,[.4] Aeterian.[AN][MoveLeft]

[OpenRight]
We don't have to explain anything to[N]
soldiers of Wreyvine.[AN]
It would be wise to mind your[N]
own business,[.4] old man.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadAffo]
Sir Ulrich[Beat]?[.6] I don't[N]
think this is a good idea.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
[Pause]We aren't turning back until you[N]
tell us what you're doing in these ruins.[AN]

[OpenRight]
Nothing we say will be of[N]
any use to you.[AN][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][.4]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]Come on,[.4] let's give our[N]
guests a nice welcome.[AN]
[MoveMidRight]Leave no trace of this[N]
behind![A][X]

## Prologue4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich]
Alright,[.4] everyone.[.6] Stay close,[.4][N]
but split if necessary.[.6][AN]
We don't want to waste time-[.4] there[N]
may be reinforcements lurking.[AN]
If we lay low now,[.4] we will have[N]
a moment of opportunity-[AN]
We'll strike [ToggleRed]before they[N]
can react[ToggleRed].[AN]
Affogato,[.4] you're the squad's scout,[.4][N]
so you'll seize when the time comes.[AN]
Follow my lead.[.6][N]
Understood?[AN][X]

Be on your guard,[.4] we don't[N]
know what might arrive.[A][X]

## WhenTheWallIsSus2
[OpenMidRight][LoadAnsgar]Hrm,[.4] the wall's of brittle[N]
Wreyvian cobblestone[Beat][AN]
Time's really done a number[N]
on it,[.4] eh?[AN]
Looks like the [ToggleRed]entire wall[ToggleRed]'ll crumble[N]
if [ToggleRed]a part[ToggleRed] of it breaks.[A][X]

## WhenTheWallIsSus
# holy shit he doesnt say sus anymore !?? ? ? ? ?!!!
[OpenMidRight][LoadAffo]That wall looks[N]
questionable,[.4] doesn't it[Beat]?[AN]
It looks like if we hit a part[N]

the [ToggleRed]entire wall would[N]
collapse[ToggleRed][Beat][A][X]

There has to be a reason why the[N]
Aeterians seized this place.[AN]
Yet now there's no trace[N]

[OpenLeft]Maybe we should inform the King[N]

[OpenFarRight]Mm.[.6] I got a feelin' this ain't[N]

[OpenRight]So we're headed for Wreyvine's[N]

[OpenFarRight][LoadMaynard]
[OpenRight][LoadAoife]
[OpenRight][Pause]So you're sending Aeterian soldiers to[N]
Wreyvine[Beat] over a book?[.6] A.[.6] Book.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]This sounds like overkill,[.4] Your[N]
Majesty.[.6] On several levels.[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]You don't understand[N]
what's at stake.[AN]
The Wreyvians are casting a shadow[N]
over Aeteria.[AN]
The 'book' is a magical heirloom-[.4] a[N]
tome known as the Eye of Creation.[AN]
The tome is destined to recreate Ideon-[.4][N]
banishing us to the shadows in snow.[AN]
Similar to our arc's fate to obliterate[N]
Ideon to naught but ashes.[AN]
The Hallowed One will smite down[N]
the Ashen Rider,[.4] once again.[AN]
Wreyvine will eclipse Aeteria again,[.4] ending[N]
the balance like the legends told[Beat][AN]
And we will all be consumed[N]
by undying cold.[AN]
[OpenRight]
[Pause]So what?[.6] Not gonna happen in[N]
my lifetime.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Mm,[.4] what she said.[.6] This is neat[N]
and all but I really don't care.[AN]
Not like I got anything to[N]
lose anymore.[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]
A vessel for Wreyvine's patron god,[.4] the[N]
Holy King,[.4] has come to light in the North.[AN]
With it,[.4] their influence grows.[.6][N]
With it,[.4] the prophecy comes true.[AN]
[OpenRight][Pause]Huh.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][Beat][AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]
Aeteria has to take action before[N]
Wreyvine begins their march.[AN]
We must take the Eye of Creation,[.4][N]
lest we be left behind again.[AN]
We can't have Wreyvine's King repeat[N]
history and stifle us in snow.[AN]
Aoife,[.4] Maynard,[.6] and[N]
Eustace.[.6] You three-[.4][AN]
Aeteria's Trinity,[.4] are the only ones[N]
I can trust with this feat[Beat][A][X]

[OpenRight]Not well,[.4] I'm 'fraid.[.6][N]
One spell and I'm done for,[.4] eh?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[.6] I'm sure the others[N]
feel the same way.[AN]
[OpenRight]Magic is a lot more common in Aeteria[N]
than it is here in Wreyvine.[AN]
Not good for us in this skirmish[N]
when none of us can withstand it.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Maybe so,[.4] but I feel like[N]
their magic[Beat][AN]
I feel like their magic doesn't affect[N]
me like it affects the rest of us.[AN]
[OpenRight][Pause]That's a bold claim,[.4][N]
eh, Affogato?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Want me to prove it?[AN]
[OpenRight]I'd rather not watch you[N]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey,[.4] 'Gato![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[.6] Do you need[N]
something?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're the new[N]
recruit,[.4] right?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah,[.4] something[N]
like that.[AN]
I'm not really sure[N]
why I'm here.[AN]
Everyone else is dressed in[N]
their fancy armors,[AN]
while I'm here just[Beat][N]
being some marksman.[AN]
I thought I'd be waiting[N]
like the other two.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Aw,[.4] don't[N]
say that![AN]
Don't be so hard[N]
on yourself.[AN]
Sir Ulrich thought you were[N]
capable enough to be here.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Hm,[.4] I guess so.[.6][N]
Yet[Beat] Nevermind,[.4] thanks.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight]Sir Ulrich,[.4] are you[N]
alright?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm alright.[.6] Just a few[N]
things on my mind.[AN]
Why would the Aeterian royal army be[N]
here,[.4] of all places?[AN]
And what in the world are[N]
they doing here?[AN]
They can't just be taking some[N]
casual stroll in Wreyvine.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It all seems very[N]
suspicious.[AN]
If they had a good reason to be here,[.4][N]
we wouldn't be fighting right now.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Mm.[.6] I just fear this is the[N]
start of something terrible[Beat][A][X]
