# Wreyvians and Aeterians
The twin kingdoms of[N]
Wreyvine and Aeteria.[A][2NL]
A creator's kingdom of genesis.[.6][N]
An eternal kingdom of oblivion.[A][2NL]
Together they make up the[N]
continent of Ideon.[A][2NL]
The balance is held by the[N]
constants-[.4] deities[N]
of Wreyvine and Aeteria.[A][2NL]
A pale bird perched atop the Holy King.[.6][N]
A black horse saddled by the Dark Rider.[A][2NL]
Yet today,[.4] winter of[N]
year 143,[.4] that balance[N]
begins to shift...[A][X]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadHildr]
[OpenMidRight]Alright,[.4] listen up.[.6] The King has[N]
tasked us with securing[AN]
the ruins of Greyfrost.[.6] Apparently[N]
it used to be a Wreyvian fortress.[AN]
Not that you can really[N]
tell nowadays.[AN]
It's not really in the best condition,[.4][N]
so we have to have to make sure[AN]
there's no trouble brewing[N]
or anything like that.[AN]
[OpenLeft]Should be easy enough.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Overconfident as[N]
ever,[.4] Breve![.6][AN]
[OpenLeft]"Overconfident"?[.6] Hildr,[.4] [ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]I prefer[N]
the term "right".[ToggleSmile][AN][OpenEyes]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]We don't know what lurks[N]
in those ruins.[AN]
What if there's ghosts?[.6] Spooky[N]
lost souls of-[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It's a small mission[N]

anything there.[AN]

first day,[.4] rookie?[AN]
That's a heck of a[N]
first impression.[AN]
[Left]Good morning to[N]
you too,[.4] Breve.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Not just the rookie.[.6][N]
Ansgar,[.4] you're late,[.4] too![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]You know how heavy this[N]
darned armor is.[AN]
Bettin' ya anyone else would crumble[N]
tryin' to wear this.[AN]
[Left]It's okay.[.6] The[Beat] er-[.4] late crow[N]

[OpenFarFarRight]Settle down,[.4][N]
everyone.[AN][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
Affogato.[.6] Ansgar.[.6] His Majesty has[N]
trusted us to secure the Greyfrost ruins.[AN]
I'd prefer if we didn't waste[N]
any more time.[AN]
Come on,[.4] now,[.6] Let us begin[N]
the march,[.4] everyone.[A][X]

## Prologue2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBreve][OpenLeft][LoadHildr]
[OpenLeft][Pause]Are you sure this is the[N]
right place?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]No other place in Wreyvine[N]
like it,[.4] I'd reckon.[AN]
[OpenLeft]I don't like the[N]
air of this place.[AN]
[OpenRight][LoadAnsgarLeft][OpenFarRight][LoadAnsgarRight]
[OpenRight]We'll be fine.[.6] Stand by me[N]
and this'll be over quick.[AN]
The other recruits are waitin'[N]
for us outside.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadAffogato][OpenLeft][LoadUlrich][OpenFarRight][LoadShaman]
[OpenFarLeft]What are Aeterians doing[N]
here in Wreyvian soil?[AN][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveFarLeft]

[OpenLeft][LoadHildr][MoveLeft]
[OpenLeft]Hey,[.4] you![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.4]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Hold on.[.6] Are you knights[N]
of Aeteria?[AN]
Did the Queen send you?[.6][N]
What are you here for?[AN][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][Left][MoveMidLeft]

[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][.4][MoveMidRight]
[Pause]Oi,[.4] boss![.6] We[N]

[OpenRight][LoadMarc]
Hrm?[.6] You all are[Beat][N]
knights of Wreyvine.[AN]
And you[Beat] You're the leader[N]
of this band?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
You'd do well to explain what your[N]
intentions here.[AN][MoveLeft]

[OpenRight]
We don't have to explain anything to[N]
soldiers of Wreyvine.[AN]
It would be wise to mind your[N]
own business,[.4] old man.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadAffo]
Sir Ulrich[Beat]?[.6] I don't[N]
think this is a good idea.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
[Pause]We aren't turning back until you[N]
tell us your motivations.[AN]

[OpenRight]
Nothing we say will be of[N]
any use to you.[AN][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][.4]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]Come on,[.4] let's give our[N]
guests a nice welcome.[AN]
[MoveMidRight]Leave no trace of this[N]
behind![A][X]

## Prologue4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich]
Alright,[.4] everyone.[.6] Stay close,[.4][N]
but split if necessary.[.6][AN]
We don't want to waste time-[.4] there[N]
may be reinforcements lurking.[AN]
If we lay low now,[.4] we will have[N]
a moment of opportunity.[AN]
Follow my lead.[.6][N]
Understood?[AN][X]

Be on your guard,[.4] we don't[N]
know what might arrive.[A][X]

## WhenTheWallIsSus2
[OpenMidRight][LoadAnsgar]Hrm,[.4] a wall made of[N]
loose Wreyvian cobblestone.[AN]
Time's really done a number[N]
on it,[.4] eh?[AN]
Looks like the [ToggleRed]entire wall[ToggleRed]'ll crumble[N]
if [ToggleRed]a part[ToggleRed] of it breaks.[A][X]

## WhenTheWallIsSus
# holy shit he doesnt say sus anymore !?? ? ? ? ?!!!
[OpenMidRight][LoadAffo]That wall looks[N]
questionable[Beat][AN]
It looks like if we hit[N]
it hard enough,[AN]
the [ToggleRed]entire wall would[N]
collapse[ToggleRed][Beat][A][X]

[OpenMidRight]You haven't fulfilled your[N]
part of the deal,[.4] thief.[AN]
Without the whereabouts of[N]
the Eye,[AN]
I'm afraid we cannot continue[N]
our agreement.[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]Tsch.[.6] So be[N]

We don't need your[N]
help,[.4] anyways.[A][X]

[OpenLeft]We're done here.[AN]

[MidLeft]The ruins are secured.[.6][N]
Whew,[.4] that was really something.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Affogato,[.4] you're a natural[N]
on the battlefield.[AN]
[Pause]Are you sure you're just[N]
a hunter?[AN]
[OpenRight]What were Aeterians[N]
doing here?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]I don't know,[.4] but they're[N]
gone for now.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadHildr]
[OpenFarLeft]It can't just be a[N]
coincidence,[.4] right?[AN]
There has to be a reason why[N]
the Aeterians were here.[AN]
Yet now there's no trace[N]
that they were ever here.[AN]
[OpenLeft]Maybe we should inform[N]
the King?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Mm.[.6] I got a feelin' this ain't[N]
the last of 'em.[AN]
[OpenRight]So we're headed for the[N]
Pale Palace,[.4] right?[AN]
That's where the King[N]
resides.[AN][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadUlrich]
Indeed.[.6] We must bring the news[N]
to the King.[AN]
We must make haste,[.4][N]
everyone.[.6] Let's move.[A][X]

[OpenRight][LoadAoife]
[OpenFarFarLeft][Pause]The Dark Rider will make[N]
her return.[AN]
A suitable vessel has appeared in[N]
the north.[AN]
Yet to the north,[.4] the Holy King[N]
found a vessel in Wreyvine.[AN]
[OpenRight]And what will happen,[.4][N]
Your Majesty?[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]With the gods of Ideon returning,[.4][N]
the balance will soon begin to shift.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]So[Beat] What can we do[N]
about it?[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]There lies an heirloom-[.4] a tome[N]
known as the Eye of Ideon.[AN]
A constant between heaven and earth[N]
that binds past and future,[AN]
the tome is an accord between[N]
the two kingdoms.[AN]
It stands tall in the resting grounds-[.4] the[N]
neutral zone between Wreyvine and Aeteria.[AN]
Yet yesterday,[.4] the tome went[N]
missing from its pedestal[Beat][AN]
The unbinding of the Eye must have[N]
awakened the gods.[AN]
The Eye must be in[N]
Wreyvine.[AN]
We must recover the Eye and put it[N]
in its rightful place.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Can you stop speaking so[N]
fast?[.6] There's too m-[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]There's no time for us[N]
to waste,[.4] Maynard.[AN]
Everyone in these halls[N]
know that.[AN]
[OpenRight][Beat]
[OpenFarFarLeft]General Aoife.[.6] You are to stop[N]
my daughter, should she resist.[AN]
Maynard,[.4] you are to defend Aeteria-[.4][N]
a counterattack is inevitable.[AN]
And Eustace[Beat] is working on[N]
a new way to harness ether.[AN]
These soldiers will attack and[N]
conquer Wreyvine.[AN]
The Trinity will bring failure.[.6][N]
Is this made clear?[A]
[OpenRight]Of course,[.4] Your[N]
Majesty[Beat][AN]
[OpenFarRight][Beat][AN]
[OpenRight][Pause]Maynard?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Yes.[.6] We will not[N]

[OpenRight]Not well,[.4] I'm 'fraid.[.6][N]
One spell and I'm done for.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[.6] I'm sure the others[N]
feel the same way.[AN]
Yet I feel like magic doesn't affect[N]
me like it affects the others.[AN]
[OpenRight]I don't understand[Beat] but I'll[N]
try to use this rare gift.[AN]

hunting?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][Pause]Hmm,[.4] not sure.[.6] My memory[N]

I don't really remember much about[N]
my past aside from being a hunter.[AN]

Where are you from?[AN]

recruit,[.4] right?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah,[.4] something[N]
like that.[AN]
I'm not really sure[N]
why I'm here.[AN]
Everyone else is dressed in[N]
their fancy armors,[AN]
while I'm here just[Beat][N]
being some marksman.[AN]
I thought I'd be waiting[N]
like the other two.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Aw,[.4] don't[N]
say that![AN]
Don't be so hard[N]
on yourself.[AN]
Sir Ulrich thought you were[N]
capable enough to be here.[AN]
