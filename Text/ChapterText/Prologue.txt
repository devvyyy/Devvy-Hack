[OpenFarFarRight]Sir Ulrich.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Back already?[AN][Event]
[OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidRight]We've received reports of shamans[N]
grouping near the villages.[AN]
The shamans relocated to near[N]
the abandoned ruins.[AN]
It looks as though they're preparing[N]
for their next move.[AN]
If there's an opportunity to[N]
engage,[.4] it's now.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[.6] Is everyone[N]
here?[AN]
This is a minor mission,[.4] our numbers[N]
are small.[AN]

at once.[AN][X]

[OpenLeft][LoadHildr][OpenFarLeft][LoadBreve]
[OpenLeft][Pause]Are you sure this is the[N]
right place?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]No other place in Wreyvine[N]
like it,[.4] I'd reckon.[AN]
[OpenLeft]I don't like the[N]
air of this place.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]The King has tasked us with[N]
ridding this place of shamans.[AN]
Stay close,[.4] but split if[N]
necessary.[.6][AN]
We don't want to waste time-[.4] there[N]
may be reinforcements lurking.[AN]
If we lay low now,[.4] we will have[N]
a moment of opportunity.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Follow my lead.[.6][N]
Understood?[AN][X]

part of the deal,[.4] thief.[AN]
Without the whereabouts of[N]
the Eye,[AN]
I'm afraid we cannot continue[N]

Affogato?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm just wondering who exactly[N]
we're fighting,[.4] is all.[AN]
They're shamans,[.4] but why[N]
are they here?[AN]

why I'm here.[AN]
Everyone else is dressed in[N]
their fancy armors,[AN]
while I'm here just[Beat][N]
being some marksman.[AN]
I thought I'd be waiting[N]
like the other two.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Aw,[.4] don't[N]
say that![AN]

on yourself.[AN]
Sir Ulrich thought you were[N]
