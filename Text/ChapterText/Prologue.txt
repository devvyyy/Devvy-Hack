Together they make up the[N]

The balance is held by two[N]

[.6]Duke Selwyn and Apostle Sylveria of Aeteria.[.6][N]
How do you fare on this fine night?[AN]

[L]
Ah[,] Count Wellington.[.6] We extend our welcome[N]
to your arrival.[.6] Pray tell, what brings[N]
your presence at such a late hour?[AN][Clear]
Is something amiss?[AN]

[R]
Duke[Beat] Apostle[Beat] I'm afraid I[Beat][N]
bear naught but grave news tonight.[AN][Event][Clear]
Empress Zoria of Aeteria[Beat][N]
has been assassinated.[AN]

[FL]
[Beat]![AN]

[L]
No[Beat] This can't be![.6] You're speaking[N]
nothing but falsehoods![AN]

[R][MoveMidRight][MR]
I beg of you,[.4] my duke.[.6][N]
Compose yourself.[AN]

[L]
Who was it,[.4] Wulfric?![.6] Tell me![.6][N]
A political adversary from one of our[N]
territories?[.6] Which of the three?![AN]

[MR]
No,[.4] there was no trace to suggest the[N]
perpetrator is of Aeteria.[.6] In fact,[.4] we[N]
suspect the assassin is Wreyvian.[AN]
The situation is still ongoing,[.4][N]
but considering we crushed them[N]
underfoot years prior[Beat][AN]

[FL]
Why would they[Beat][N]
An act of vengeance?[AN]

[L]
Now,[.4] our Aeterian Trinity.[.6] They were[N]
posted to guard her.[.6] Where were[N]
they in that dire hour?[AN]

[MR]
The Trinity claim that the Wreyvian assassin[N]
crept into Castle Aeteria under the guise[N]
of nightfall and the aid of magic.[AN][Clear]
It was then that they struck.[AN]

[L]
[MoveLeft]Bah![.6] Worthless,[.4] the Trinity are![.6][N]
I should have them demoted and tried[N]
for their incompetence![AN][Clear]
How could they just let such[N]
a calamity transpire?![AN]

[MR][MoveFarRight]
My duke[Beat][AN]

[L]
No,[.4] my apologies.[.6] It is ill beneath my[N]
station to behave so[Beat] uncouth.[.6][N]
But even so[Beat] I[Beat] Mother[Beat][an][Clear]
Wulfric[Beat] You may leave.[.6] I pray you[N]
a safe journey home.[AN]

[FR][ClearFace][FL][ClearFace][MR][LoadSylveria][L][MoveMidLeft][.4]

[MR]
Sel,[.4] I[Beat] Why[Beat]?[.6] What will we do?[AN]

[ML]
I suppose this was perhaps inevitable.[.6][N]
Aeteria and Wreyvine have long been at[N]
odds.[.6] But to assassinate the Empress?![AN]
This is an act of war,[.4] a declaration[N]
by Wreyvine![.6] Our empire looms vast.[.6][N]
Our militia,[.4] grander,[.4] much more[N]
powerful than they can even imagine.[AN]
We decimated them in the holy war.[.6] What[N]
could Wreyvine possibly hope to achieve[N]
with such a gambit[Beat]?[AN]

[MR]
In darkness[Beat] I[Beat] I will[N]
be with you,[.4] Sel.[AN]

[ML]
Worry not,[.4] Sylvie![.6] Wreyvine has made[N]
themselves Aeteria's enemy yet again.[.6][N]
We will decimate them.[.6] Annihilate them.[AN]
Our magical prowess is absolute.[.6] Wreyvine[N]
will pay for its crimes[,] and the King[N]
of Wreyvine will fall by my hand.[AN][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]I swear on it![AN]

[FL][ClearFace][L][ClearFace]

[MR]
Uh.[.6] Ahem.[.6][Event] As I was saying[Beat][N]
Actually,[.4] let me start over.[A][2NL]
I'm Ulrich,[.4] the lieutenant of the[N]
newly-formed 7th Platoon.[.6] I retired[N]
years ago,[.4] but[Beat] Well[Beat][AN]
Fate always finds its way,[.4] and I'm[N]
here as a knight errant of sorts.[.6][N]
Er,[.4] anyways[Beat][AN]
King Anatolius himself has tasked us[N]
with securing the ruins just south[N]
of us today.[AN]
Apparently,[.4] it used to be some Wreyvian[N]
stronghold.[.6] Not that you can really[N]
tell nowadays[Beat][AN]
It's not really in the best condition,[.4][N]
so we have to make sure there's no[N]
trouble brewing or anything like that.[AN]

[L][LoadBreve]
Yeah,[.4] yeah.[.6] Should be easy enough.[.6N]
I didn't think I'd need to wake up[N]
so early for this crap.[AN]

[FL][LoadHildr]
Wow,[.4] overconfident as ever,[.4] Breve![.6N]
Maybe our team should just be comprised[N]
of you[Beat] five times.[AN]

[L]
You say [OpenQuote]overconfident",[.4] but I think[N]
you really mean [OpenQuote]right",[.4] Hildr.[.6N]
Knighthood is easy as[Beat][AN][Clear]
Well[,] I'll need to think on that one[,] but[N]
just 'cause we've less experience as knights[N]
doesn't mean bandits are a threat.[AN]

[FL]
Well,[.4] we don't know what lurks[N]
in there[Beat][AN]

[MR][MoveFarRight][R][LoadAnsgar]

[R]
Just sayin',[.4] we should be careful.[.6][N]
Whole thing could be a lot more trouble[N]
there than it's worth,[.4] eh.[AN]

[FL]
But![.6] What if there's GHOSTS or[N]
something?![.6] Ooooooooh[Beat]![AN]

[L]
[MidBlink]Please stop.[AN][OpenEyes]

[R]
Ah[,] that'd be terrifyin'![.6] Hildr[,][N]
you oughta quit that[Beat][AN]

[FR]
It's a small mission for a small squadron.[.6][N]
I highly doubt there's anything unusual there.[N]
Come on,[.4] now! Let us begin the mission.[AN]

Why're you lot here?[AN]

[L]
What are Aeterian soldiers doing here[N]
on Wreyvian soil?[.6] Did your Empress[N]
send you?[.6] Why are you here?[AN]

[FR][MoveMidRight]
[FR]
You're the leader of this band?[.6] It'd be[N]
wise to mind your own business.[.6] Wreyvian[N]
soldiers should already know why we're here.[AN]

[L]
I don't think you realize the position[N]
you're in.[.6] Please start talking.[.6][N]
When my stopwatch hits five[Beat][AN]

[FR]
Aeteria's Empress is dead.[.6] Slain![.6][N]
[Pause]And her blood is on Wreyvine's hands![AN]

[L]
Is that so?[.6] We've heard nothing of the sort,[.4][N]
and we need you to move out of the way.[.6][AN]

Stay close,[.4] but split if necessary.[.6][N]
We don't want to waste time--[.4]there may be[N]
reinforcements lurking.[AN]
If we lay low now,[.4] there'll be a[N]
moment of opportunity.[.6] We'll strike[N]
before they can react.[AN]
Affogato,[.4] you're the 7th Platoon's scout,[.4][N]
so you'll stay back and seize[N]

Follow my lead,[.4] understood?[AN][Event]

Opal,[.4] I just cannot abide by the Duke's[n]
sudden campaign.[.6] What was he thinking?[.6][N]
Was he in his cups,[.4] perhaps?[AN]

[MR]
Count Wellington,[.4] it is not the start of[N]
the war.[.6] With so many armies in the invasion,[.4][N]
I would say the war is already ongoing.[AN]
Yet we of the Imperial Guard have been[N]

Truly ridiculous.[.6] Unacceptable,[.4] even.[.6][N]

A man wearing a grey hat atop a dark[N]

## PrologueSummary
    Year 643, 12/3 - Entry 1[AClear]
Today was my first day as an official[N]
Wreyvian soldier in the 7th Platoon.[AClear]
I've done brief scouting and delivery[N]
missions before, but hardly any of them[N]
took place directly on a battlefield.[AClear]
I met 3 knights--Breve, Hildr, and Ansgar[,][N]
and our commander, Sir Ulrich.[N]
We explored an abandoned stronghold[N]
to look for any sort of problems inside.[AClear]
It wasn't long before we ran into soldiers[N]
from Aeteria, who told us that their[N]
Empress had been assassinated...[AClear]
And that Duke Selwyn had led a mass[N]
invasion into Wreyvine![AClear]
We didn't waste any time and fought[N]
them off, clearing out the ruins in[N]
the process.[N]
It was an... oddly refreshing change of[N]
pace from hunting game back home.[AClear]
Now we're heading back to report[N]
to the King about what happened.[AClear]
I do wonder, though... Is this the[N]
start of another war?[A][X]

Come now,[.4] oh Breve the Prickly and Valiant![.6][N]
We got lotsa work to do.[.6] Don'tcha wanna[N]
make the Iron Tusks proud today?[AN]

[MR]
Huh[Beat]?[.6] Oh,[.4] just shut up,[.4] Gary.[6N]
I don't think Wreyvine's patron god gives[N]
any damn about our situation here.[AN]

[ML]
Just tryin' to lighten the mood,[.4] buddy.[.6][N]
You've been pricklier than usual lately.[.6N]
Is everythin' okay?[AN]

[MR]
I don't need you to lighten the damned mood.[.6N]
This is our first battle against Aeterian[N]
soldiers in[Beat] so many long years.[AN][Clear]
Until today,[.4] it's always been skirmishes[N]
against brigands or some other rabble.[AN]

[ML]
Brigands are a lot better than fightin'[N]
Aeterian soldiers,[.4] eh?[.6] They outnumber[N]
us,[.4] they're probably more trained[Beat][an]
Heck,[.4] by the looks of it,[.4] they just[n]
arrived,[.4] and they already own the place.[an]
I just don't get it.[AN][Clear]
They beat us in the old war.[.6] They took[N]
our lands[,] our steel[Beat] What else[N]
could they possibly want from us?[AN]

[MR]
Strength controls Wreyvine.[.6] One's skill in[N]
combat and smithwork is rewarded in their[N]
worth.[.6] That's just how it is.[an]
We lost pretty terribly twenty-four years[N]
ago and I don't think the kingdom[N]
ever recovered.[AN]
If you can't fight well or hammer out steel[N]
for people to fight well[,] you don't make[N]
it out.[.6] And I need to make it out.[AN]

[ML]
I getcha[,] I getcha.[6n]
Guess we can't forget our roots[,][n]
even after twenty-four years[,] eh?[AN]

[MR]
We have to prove ourselves--[.4]with strength[,][N]
with victory--[.4]on the battlefield[,][N]
now and always.[AN][Clear]
Never forget that[,] Ansgar.[AN][X]

hanky[,] but now[Beat][AN]

[MR]
Ser Hildr.[.6] Where did your energy[N]
from earlier go?[AN]

[ML]
I guess it just didn't really set in yet.[6N]
Like[Beat] Woah![.6] We're fighting Aeterians![AN][Clear]
Like[,] Aeteria--[.4]the fancy empire on the[N]
other side of the bridge![AN]
Way larger than the kingdom![.6] The army[N]
filled with powerful[,] menacing magic that[N]
Gramps won't tell me about[Beat][AN]
I've never seen real magic casted before.[6N]
It looks as dangerous as they say.[.6] They[N]
really practice soul-absorbing spells?[AN][Clear]
How heretical[Beat] That's terrifying![AN]

[mr]
You've never seen magic up-close?[AN]

[ML]
Never.[.6] The thought of power so destructive[N]
and uncontrollable makes me uneasy[Beat][N]
I'm at ease it's outlawed in Wreyvine.[AN]

[mr]
It's true.[.6] Elder magic is horrifying[,][N]
yes[Beat] But casting spells leave a mage[N]
open to blows from a blade.[AN]
The Aeterian army consists mostly of mages.[6N]
It's standard practice to use one's gift[N]
of magic to bolster the military.[AN]

[ml]
But here[,] it's rightfully viewed as an[N]
affliction to those born with it.[6N]
What a terrifying thought[Beat][AN][Clear]
You know a lot about Aeteria[,] sir![6N]
Have you fought many in the war?[AN]

[mr]
[Pause]It's easier to put it that way.[AN]
