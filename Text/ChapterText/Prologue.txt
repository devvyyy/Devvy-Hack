# Wreyvians and Aeterians
The twin kingdoms of[N]
Wreyvine and Aeteria.[A][2NL]
A creator's kingdom of genesis.[.6][N]
An eternal kingdom of oblivion.[A][2NL]
Together they make up the[N]
continent of Ideon.[A][2NL]
The balance is held by the[N]
constants-[.4] deities[N]
of Wreyvine and Aeteria.[A][2NL]
A pale bird perched atop the Holy King.[.6][N]
A black horse saddled by the Dark Rider.[A][2NL]
Yet today,[.4] winter of[N]
year 143,[.4] that balance[N]
begins to shift...[A][X]

## Prologue1
[OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenLeft][LoadBreve]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadHildr]
[OpenMidRight]Alright,[.4] listen up.[.6] The King has[N]
tasked us with securing the Hoarfrost ruins.[AN]
Apparently,[.4] it used to be a[N]
Wreyvian stronghold.[AN]
Not that you can really[N]
tell nowadays.[AN]
It's not really in the best condition,[.4][N]
so we have to have to make sure[AN]
there's no trouble brewing[N]
or anything like that.[AN]
[OpenLeft]Should be easy enough.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Overconfident as[N]
ever,[.4] Breve![.6][AN]
[OpenLeft]"Overconfident"?[.6] Hildr,[.4] [ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]I prefer[N]
the term "right".[ToggleSmile][AN][OpenEyes]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]We don't know what lurks[N]
in those ruins.[AN]
It's just ruins.[.6] Probably brigands[N]
or something similar.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It's a small mission[N]
for a small squadron.[AN]
I highly doubt there's[N]
anything there.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleSmile]Right![.6] A small mission for[Beat][N]
[ToggleSmile][Pause]Where are the others,[.4] anyways?[AN][.6]

[OpenRight][LoadBreve]
[OpenFarRight][LoadHildr]
[OpenRight]You're late on your[N]
first day,[.4] rookie?[AN]
That's a heck of a[N]
first impression.[AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]Good morning to[N]
you too,[.4] Breve.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Not just the rookie.[.6][N]
Ansgar,[.4] you're late,[.4] too![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]You know how heavy this[N]
darned armor is.[AN]
Bettin' ya anyone else would crumble[N]
tryin' to wear this.[AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]It's okay.[.6] The[Beat] er-[.4] late crow[N]
gets[Beat] uhm[Beat][AN]
[OpenFarFarRight]Settle down,[.4][N]
everyone.[AN][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
Affogato.[.6] Ansgar.[.6] His Majesty has[N]
trusted us to secure the ruins.[AN]
I'd prefer if we didn't waste[N]
any more time.[AN]
Come on,[.4] now,[.6] Let us begin[N]
the march,[.4] everyone.[A][X]

## Prologue2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBreve][OpenLeft][LoadHildr]
[OpenLeft][Pause]Are you sure this is the[N]
right place?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]No other place in Wreyvine[N]
like it,[.4] I'd reckon.[AN]
[OpenLeft]I don't like the[N]
air of this place.[AN]
[OpenRight][LoadAnsgarLeft][OpenFarRight][LoadAnsgarRight]
[OpenRight]We'll be fine.[.6] Stand by me[N]
and this'll be over quick.[AN]
The other recruits are waitin'[N]
for us outside.[AN]

## Prologue3
[OpenFarLeft][LoadAffogato][OpenLeft][LoadUlrich][OpenFarRight][LoadShaman]
[OpenFarLeft]What are Aeterians doing[N]
here in Wreyvian soil?[AN][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveFarLeft]

[OpenLeft][LoadHildr][MoveLeft]
[OpenLeft]Hey,[.4] you![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.4]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Hold on.[.6] Are you knights[N]
of Aeteria?[AN]
Did the Queen send you?[.6][N]
What are you here for?[AN][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][Left][MoveMidLeft]

[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][.4][MoveMidRight]
[Pause]Oi,[.4] boss![.6] We[N]
got visitors![AN][MoveFarRight]

[OpenRight][LoadMarc]
Hrm?[.6] You all are[Beat][N]
knights of Wreyvine.[AN]
And you[Beat] You're the leader[N]
of this band?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
You'd do well to explain what your[N]
intentions here.[AN][MoveLeft]

[OpenRight]
We don't have to explain anything to[N]
soldiers of Wreyvine.[AN]
It would be wise to mind your[N]
own business,[.4] old man.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadAffo]
Sir Ulrich[Beat]?[.6] I don't[N]
think this is a good idea.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
[Pause]We aren't turning back until you[N]
tell us what you're doing in these ruins.[AN]

[OpenRight]
Nothing we say will be of[N]
any use to you.[AN][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][.4]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight]Come on,[.4] let's give our[N]
guests a nice welcome.[AN]
[MoveMidRight]Leave no trace of this[N]
behind![A][X]

## Prologue4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich]
Alright,[.4] everyone.[.6] Stay close,[.4][N]
but split if necessary.[.6][AN]
We don't want to waste time-[.4] there[N]
may be reinforcements lurking.[AN]
If we lay low now,[.4] we will have[N]
a moment of opportunity.[AN]
Follow my lead.[.6][N]
Understood?[AN][X]

## StairsWarning

[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffo]The [ToggleRed]stairs[ToggleRed][Beat][AN]
I don't like the sound[N]
resonating from them.[AN]
Be on your guard,[.4] we don't[N]
know what might arrive.[A][X]

## WhenTheWallIsSus2
[OpenMidRight][LoadAnsgar]Hrm,[.4] a wall made of[N]
loose Wreyvian cobblestone.[AN]
Time's really done a number[N]
on it,[.4] eh?[AN]
Looks like the [ToggleRed]entire wall[ToggleRed]'ll crumble[N]
if [ToggleRed]a part[ToggleRed] of it breaks.[A][X]

## WhenTheWallIsSus
# holy shit he doesnt say sus anymore !?? ? ? ? ?!!!
[OpenMidRight][LoadAffo]That wall looks[N]
questionable,[.4] doesn't it[Beat]?[AN]
It looks like if we hit a part[N]
of it hard enough,[AN]
the [ToggleRed]entire wall would[N]
collapse[ToggleRed][Beat][A][X]

[OpenMidRight]You haven't fulfilled your[N]
part of the deal,[.4] thief.[AN]
Without the whereabouts of[N]
the Eye,[AN]
I'm afraid we cannot continue[N]
our agreement.[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]Tsch.[.6] So be[N]

[OpenRight]Their leader is down.[.4] They[N]
have been driven out,[.4] for now.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Yet Hildr and Ansgar were[N]
killed in the process[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]
Either of us could be next,[.4][N]

[OpenRight][LoadUlrich]
You're right[Beat][.6] We must inform[N]
him at once.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][Pause]Are you alright,[.4][N]
sir[Beat]?[.6] You seem pale.[AN]
[OpenRight]Their deaths weigh on[N]
my mind[Beat][AN]
This is already a small squadron-[.4][N]
we cannot afford any more lives.[AN]
The king's palace is north[N]

Come,[.4] now.[.6] We can't let[N]
their sacrifices be in vain.[A][X]

[OpenFarLeft]Dastard mages,[.4] I tell ya.[.6][N]
[MoveFarLeft]Can't stand 'em.[AN]
That's just how it is,[.4][N]
I suppose.[AN]
One day you know 'em and the[N]

Be careful,[.4] rookie.[.6] You could[N]
end the same way.[AN]

their actions today.[AN]
Yet[Beat] Why were they[N]
here?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]There's no trace that they[N]

[OpenRight][CloseEyes]They tore through his armor[N]

Magic is just as scary as[N]
I thought.[AN]
There's nothing for us[N]

[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]Is this another trial[N]

[OpenEyes]Either one of us could[N]

[OpenFarRight]This is a peek for[N]

Why were they here in the first place?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]I didn't realize we would[N]
run into death so soon[Beat][AN]
[OpenFarRight]The pain never dulls,[.4][N] Affogato.[.6][N]

that was really something.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Affogato,[.4] you're a natural[N]

[Pause]Are you sure you're just[N]
a hunter?[AN]
[OpenRight]What were Aeterians[N]
doing here?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]I don't know,[.4] but they're[N]
gone for now.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadHildr]
[OpenFarLeft]It can't just be a[N]
coincidence,[.4] right?[AN]
There has to be a reason why[N]
the Aeterians were here.[AN]
Yet now there's no trace[N]
that they were ever here.[AN]
[OpenLeft]Maybe we just inform the King[N]
of what we found here?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Mm.[.6] I got a feelin' this ain't[N]
the last of 'em.[AN]
[OpenRight]So we're headed for the[N]
Pale Palace,[.4] right?[AN]
That's where the King[N]
resides.[AN][OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadUlrich]
Indeed.[.6] We must bring the news[N]

[OpenMidRight]We paid a heavy price[N]
on this day.[AN]
The Aeterians will pay for[N]
their actions in exchange.[AN]
But informing His Majesty of what we[N]
found here is of utmost priority.[AN]
His palace is north from here.[.6][N]
Let's go,[.4] Affogato.[AN]
The road ahead will be tough[N]

[OpenRight][Pause]So you're sending Aeterian soldiers to[N]
Wreyvine[Beat] over a book?[.6] A.[.6] Book.[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]You don't understand[N]
what's at stake.[AN]
The Wreyvians are casting a shadow[N]
over Aeteria.[AN]
The 'book' is an heirloom-[.4] a tome[N]
known as the Eye of Creation.[AN]
The tome is destined to recreate Ideon-[.4][N]
banishing us to the shadows.[AN]
So what?[.6] Not gonna happen in[N]
my lifetime.[AN]
A vessel for Wreyvine's patron god,[.4] the[N]
Holy King,[.4] has appeared in the North.[AN]
With it,[.4] their influence grows.[.6][N]
With it,[.4] the prophecy comes true.[AN]

One spell and I'm done for.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[.6] I'm sure the others[N]
feel the same way.[AN]
[OpenRight]Magic is a lot more common in Aeteria[N]
than it is here in Wreyvine.[AN]
Not good for us in this skirmish[N]
when none of us can withstand it.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Maybe so,[.4] but I feel like[N]
their magic[Beat][AN]
I feel like their magic doesn't affect[N]
me like it affects the rest of us.[AN]
[OpenRight][Pause]That's a bold claim,[.4]
Affogato.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Want me to prove it?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]Aw,[.4] don't[N]
say that![AN]
Don't be so hard[N]
on yourself.[AN]
Sir Ulrich thought you were[N]

[OpenMidRight]Sir Ulrich,[.4] are you[N]
alright?[AN] 
[OpenMidLeft]I'm alright.[.6] Just a few[N]
things on my mind.[AN]
Why would the Aeterian royal army be[N]
here,[.4] of all places?[AN]
And what in the world are[N]
they doing here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It all seems very[N]
suspicious.[AN]
If they had a good reason to be here,[.4][N]
we wouldn't be fighting right now.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Mm.[.6] I just fear this is the[N]
start of something terrible[Beat][A][X]
