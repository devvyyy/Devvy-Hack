Look alive[,] everyone![AN][C]
Looks like they found us after all.[6N]
They've breached the western perimeter.[6N]
We're completely surrounded.[AN]
We have to hold it.[.6] If we lose this[N]
ground now[,] the last few weeks[Beat][N]
No[,] months would've meant nothing.[AN]

[FR][Wegman]
Every alley's blocked.[.6] Scouts say the east[N]
gate's gone.[.6] We got two armies[,] and we're[N]
still boxed in[Beat][AN]

[R][Raial]
No way this isn't deliberate.[.6] They waited[N]
until we were stretched thin after[N]
the siege and then moved in.[AN][C]
They knew we'd be here.[.6] They want to[N]
wipe the board clean![AN]

[ML]
Come on[,] we dragged a whole rebellion under[N]
our wing.[.6] They must've just followed[N]
the smoke[,] yeah?[AN]

[ML][MoveLeft]
[FL][Klavdia]
No[,] this was coordinated.[.6][N]
No scouts reported this.[.6] Hell[,][N]
there weren't any visible signs[Beat][AN][C]
They clearly didn't just march here[Beat][AN]

[R]
Couldn't this have been the work of[N]
the Consuls?[.6] These are their most elite[N]

Lieutenant[Beat] Generals[Beat][N]
While you sieged the castle[,] I made[N]
preparations in the town.[AN]
I rigged each of the watch towers[N]
with explosives.[.6] This entire town[N]

We'll leave them nothing but ash[,] then.[6N]

Not so fast[,] Imperial bastards![6N]
You led them here![.6] You sold us out while[N]
we fought to keep our kingdom![AN]

Why the hell would we do that?![AN][CSS]

[FL][CF][FL][Graham]
Lord Gorlois.[.6] Please do not come to[N]
rash conclusions[Beat] You are most mistaken.[AN]
[CSS]

[FR][MoveRight]
[R]
The Emperor's army found us the moment[N]
you arrived.[.6] If that isn't damning[,][N]
then I don't know what is.[AN]
I know your style[,] Reverend.[.6] It's easier[N]
for you to cut deals when we're[N]
lambs to the slaughter.[AN][CSS]

[FL][MoveLeft]
We have little time for such conclusions.[.6][N]
If we wanted you dead[,] milord[Beat][N]
We would have done it ourselves.[AN]
Now[,] we must set the fire to the fuse.[6N]
Underneath the watch towers are tunnels[N]
rigged with oil.[AN]

[R]
[Pause]How would you know[,] Imperial?[AN]

[L]
Call it the Serpent's foresight.[.6] Or perhaps I[N]
just enjoy playing with matches?[AN]

[R]
I see[,] Reverend[Beat] Those marked tower[N]
blueprints in my tent weren't from[N]
the wind.[AN]

I have always believed in preparing[N]

You've come to end this yourself?[AN]

Did I perhaps interrupt something[N]
important?[AN][Smile]

I thought you'd never come out of hiding.[AN]

Hiding?[.6] I was never hiding.[.6] I was[N]

It is the night of a glorious full moon.[6N]
Today I stand amongst you all through[N]

I question why you would show yourself[N]

Lay no blame to my Consuls.[6N]
They had advised me not to arrive[,] but[Beat][N]
I've always had a taste for theatrics.[AN]

Say what you came here to say.[AN][CSS]

[MR][MoveRight]
United[,] you possess a miniscule threat to[N]
this holy empire.[.6] A threat that I[N]
shall take care of myself.[AN]
I am the rightful emperor who will forge[N]
the broken lands of Ideon anew to a[N]
glorious new age.[AN]

[FL][CF][Gorlois]
By butchering monarchs?[.6] By declaring[N]
divine right across red snow?[6N]
Don't you feel any ounce of regret?[AN]

[R]
A Wreyvian pierced the heart of my mother.[6N]
What came after was absolution.[6N]
Are we[Beat] not even?[AN]
Perhaps I hesitated in the beginning.[6N]
But I know now what is necessary to[N]
bring forth Ideon's new dawn.[AN]

You fear her.[.6] That's why you're here.[6N]
You know she's the rightful heir.[AN]

[R]
Her[Beat]?[AN][C]
[Pause]You mean the girl who came back.[6N]
She is no heir.[.6] She is but a pawn[N]
with a borrowed name and no crown.[AN]
And pawns do not check emperors.[6N]
She is nothing[,] and will be forgotten[N]
by these holy lands.[AN]

Tell me[,] Emperor[,] do you remember me?[AN]

Mm[,] my memory is quite sharp[,] yes.[6N]
The Sun of Wreyvine[Beat] As a scion[,] I[N]
read all about your many exploits.[AN]
What a twist of fate to see that we[N]
would meet again on the battlefield.[6N]
It is a pity to see how you turned out.[AN]
I am sure the siege at the royal palace[N]
rings memories for you[,] Lieutenant.[6N]
Do you know what sight I remember most?[AN]

You fleeing away on your lonesome.[AN]

[L]
[Pause]I wasn't alone.[AN]

[R]
Oh[,] my apologies[,] Lieutenant.[.6][N]
I am sure that you were backed up[N]
by your gracious allies in arms.[AN]
Yet the failure of an assassin with the[N]
verdant hair who always stood by your[N]
side[Beat] Where is he?[AN]
For someone who never stood out[,][N]
I can only presume he fell in times past.[6N]
Would I be right?[AN][CSS]

You made sure to fan the fires of war.[6N]
Surely this wasn't a surprise?[AN]

Oh[,] cease the bullshit.[.6] Just strike me[N]
down and be done with it.[AN]
