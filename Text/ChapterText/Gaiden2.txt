Yeah[,] they're all set up.[.6] These things[N]

Wreyvine's victory in this war[N]

That's unusually defeatist of you![.6] I[N]

I saw you across the water during[N]

[OpenQuote]Yessir".[.6] The river is where Bertrand[,] my[N]

He didn't stand a damned chance.[AN]
To answer your question[,] Otto[Beat][AN]
I joined the army for my brother's sake.[.6][N]
When the recruiter came to town[,] he was[N]
so eager to follow him to glory.[AN]

he wouldn't get himself killed.[6N]
