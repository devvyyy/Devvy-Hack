[ML]
Otto![.6] Are the barricades all ready an' up?[AN]

[FFR][MoveMidRight]
Yeah[,] they're all set up.[.6] These things[N]
should stop the Aeterian cavalry in[N]
their tracks.[.6] Suckers.[AN]

[ML]
Well done.[.6] The others should have our[N]
ballista assembled[,] too.[.6] It's not[N]
much of a fortified position[,] but[Beat][AN]

[MR]
Any idea when the Aeterians will get here?[AN]

[ML]
Not for a while.[.6] We have a moment of peace.[AN]

[MR]
In that case[Beat] Lieutenant Ulrich[,][N]
there's something I've been meaning[N]
to ask you.[AN][Clear]
We've been fighting side by[side[N]
for months now[,] but[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Fightin' for months[,] and defeat's never[N]
been closer than it has now.[.6] Speak[,][N]
Otto.[.6] This might be our last chance.[AN]

[MR]
Lieutenant.[.6] Why are you risking your life[N]
out here instead of just[Beat] giving up[N]
and running away?[AN][Clear]
Wreyvine's victory in this war[N]
seems impossible.[AN]

[ML]
That's unusually defeatist of you![.6] I[N]
could ask the same[,] I suppose.[.6] You left[N]
Aeteria to fight for Wreyvine[Beat][AN][Clear]
That makes you a traitor to their queen.[6N]
There must be a reason for that.[AN]

[MR]
I saw you across the water during[N]
the battle at Sgabeo River.[.6N]
The way you spoke to your men[Beat][AN]
It seemed almost kindly[,] even when[N]
you were harsh.[.6] That's better than[N]
anything I knew in Aeteria,[AN]
both in the army and at home[Beat] I couldn't[N]
bear the stench of booze anymore[Beat][N]
I knew I had to follow someone.[AN]

[ML]
You saw me at Sgabeo River?[AN]

[MR]
Yessir.[AN]

[ML]
The river is where Bertrand[,] my younger[N]
brother[,] was killed in combat.[6N]
He didn't stand a damned chance.[AN]
To answer your question[,] Otto[Beat][AN]
I joined the army for my brother's sake.[.6][N]
When the recruiter came to town[,] he was[N]
so eager to follow him to glory.[AN]
I knew better[,] and went with him so[N]
he wouldn't get himself killed.[6N]
Now[,] I'm the only one left.[AN]
I couldn't imagine a world where a[N]
messenger tells my family that[N]
their last child died in battle.[AN]

[MR]
Lieutenant[,] I'm sorry.[.6] For fighting[N]
in the army that hurt you, and... for all that's happened.

[ML]
Rise[,] Otto[,] and stand by my side.[.6] There's[N]
nothing to apologize for except defeat![6N]
Let's fight and live another day.[AN]

[FarFarRight]
L-[.4]Lieutenant Ulrich![.6] The enemy![6N]
They're almost here![AN]

[ML]
Are ya kiddin'[Beat] So soon?[.6] I thought we had[N]
longer[Beat] Everyone[,] form up![.6] As long[N]
as we hold the bridge[,] we can hold out![AN]

[MR]
Lieutenant[,] do you really think we can[Beat][AN]

[ML]
What I [OpenQuote]think" doesn't matter here[,] lad.[.6][N]
The odds are[Beat] grim.[.6] I know.[.6] But[N]
Lieutenant Paxima rides to reinforce our position.[AN][Clear]
We just need to survive until she arrives.[AN]

[MR]
Survive[Beat] For your sake[,] Lieutenant Ulrich[,][N]
I will.[AN]

[ML]
Let's go![.6] The enemy is incoming![AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
It appears so.[.6] Corporal Opal[,] any orders?[AN]

[MR]
I heard the stories of their weakness[Beat][N]

quite like this.[AN]
Forwards[,] brave soldiers of Aeteria![6N]

Keep your spear high[,] and never falter![AN]

[OpenLeft]

Sir.[.6] Lieutenant Paxima[Beat] is dead.[AN]

[ToggleSmile]What[Beat]?[AN]

[ToggleSmile][Beat][AN]

[MR]
The Aeterians crossed the river upstream by ship[,][N]
and tore Paxima's forces to shreds with magic.[6N]
We are all that's left of her army[AN]
and her killers come in pursuit.[AN]

[Left]
That can't[Beat] How are we meant[N]
to hold on now?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
[Pause]I don't know.[.6] But we're still alive[,][N]

[MR]
My name is Ogrim[,] Lieutenant.[.6] I am not[Beat][AN]

Don't worry. They still need Ideon's Bridge to bring the rest of their troops across. These are their only flanking force.

You want to run?![.6] Should Ideon's Bridge[N]

[Pause]No.[.6] Not yet.[.6] But[Beat] I don't[N]
think we can survive here much longer.[AN]
