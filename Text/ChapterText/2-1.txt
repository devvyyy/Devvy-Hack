[MR][LoadVerna]
Yufka and Graham must be here to rescue me.[6N]
But little do they know[Beat] I was able to[N]
snatch a little key.[AN]
Do they think a sorceress of House Kyveli[N]
would be stopped by a simple cell?[6N]
Such foolishness![AN]

[ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove][AN][CF]
No[Beat] No![.6] God damn it![6N]
I picked up the wrong key[Beat][6N]
Argh[,] curse you[,] Hayes![AN]
The moment I get out of this wretched cell[,][N]
I will tear you from limb to limb![.6][N]
YOU HEAR ME?![AN]

[FFL]
Yeah[,] we hear you.[.6] Please stay quiet.[AN]

[ML]
Just thirty minutes behind schedule.[6N]
That is adequate considering the territory.[AN]

[MR][MoveRight][FR][LoadJaye]
[FR]
Psst[,] merc[Beat] 'Thirty minutes late' really[N]
means an hour from the Reverend.[AN]

[R]
Yes[,] I'm quickly starting to understand his[N]
eccentricities[Beat] Ah[,] Reverend.[.6] This is the[N]
deepest floor of the prison[,] right?[AN][Clear]
So we gotta save those prisoners and escape.[AN]

[ML]
I am glad our faith in you was not[N]
misguided thus far.[AN]

[FR]
Verna's in that cell.[.6] Bunch of dogs[,][N]
making it personal like that.[AN]

[R]
Who's the prisoner?[.6] This looks to be the maximum[N]
security area down here--[.4]they must be dangerous[N]
or at least worth a price.[AN]

[ML][MoveFarLeft][L][LoadYufka]
Verna is a treasured member of our Order.[6N]
She was a noble to Aeteria--[.4]her betrayal of the[N]
throne marked her as an important target.[AN]

[MR]
Got it.[.6] We'll break her out and get out[N]
of this ruddy place[,] no one left behind.[AN]

[ML]
Officer Alair[,] suspicious activity was detected[N]
in the lower levels of the prison.[6] It seems[N]
these are not part of the same group of rebels[an]
that are causing a ruckus at the crown city.[an]

[MR]
A group of rebels have decided to rise and[n]
"liberate" this imperial prison?[6] Bah![6n]
What nonsense![an]

[ML]
Officer Alair[,] what would you have us do?[6n]
[Pause]Even if I think I know your answer.[an]

[MR]
It is just another group of rebels, is it not?[6n]
If they intend to intrude and disturb the peace[,][n]
then we have no choice but to respond with force.[an]

[ML]
Surely we have more important matters to attend[n]
to than to guard a few damned cells.[6n]
Who cares about the disgraced noble?[an]
Let them rot in there[,] for the Serpent's sake...[6n]
Let the silly fool inside play elegies'til[n]
they both depart.[an]

[MR]
I have never seen the prison as full as it[n]
is now... The army must be carrying out extensive[n]
incarcerations around Aeteria.[an]
I fear the Emperor must be in his cups...[an]

[ML]
Looks like the case to me.[6] I hear they're even
locking up imperial soldiers.[.6] Does that not
mark an unwise ruler;[an]
jailing their own subjects?[an]

[MR]
Meh[,] who are we to decide such things? I'm[n]
more concerned about getting a pay raise from[n]
the prisoner uptick than maunder like that.[an]

[ML]
I'd be lying if I wasn't thinking the[n]
same thing, Officer.[6] You know what would[n]
really make him an unwise ruler?[an]
Not raising our wages after giving us so[n]
many men to manage![an]

## TwoOneEnding1
[ML][LoadChiffon][MR][LoadVerna][3L]
Another one down.[.6] Hey[,] this prison's looking[N]
a little empty![AN]

[MR]
And you[Beat] must be my savior[,] Ser.[6N]
Minister.[.6] Who is this?[AN]

[ML][MoveFarLeft]

[L][LoadYufka]
This is our new mercenary ally[,] Ser Chiffon.[AN]

[MR]
Thanks[,] Ser Chiffon.[.6] Real inspired[,] watching you zip around[N]
and zap the guards like that.[AN][MoveFarRight][Clear]

[MR][LoadGraham]
Excellent results[,] everyone.[.6] It is time for[N]
us to leave.[.6] The prison no longer has any[N]
strategic value.[AN]
Especially considering the circumstances[,][N]
Ser Chiffon, you handled your responsibilities[N]
with grace and precision.[AN][Clear]
As a hypothetical[,] what do you propose we[N]
do next[,] with our situation in mind?[AN]

[FL][MoveLeft]
[CloseEyes](There's definitely a right answer...)[AN][Clear]
This is the deepest part of the prison.[6n]
Once we leave[,] you want us to regroup and[N]
strike against the empire.[AN]

[MR]
A perfect response.[.6] We shall regroup with Captain Raya[N]
and the rest of her Resistance mercenaries[N]
who reside at the quiet village of Arma.[AN]
That will be our sanctum before we begin[N]
our attack on the crown city.[AN]

[L]
Crown city?![.6] Your rebellion starts at the[N]
heart of the people?[AN]

[FL]
Yes.[.6] That is the first target.[.6] The people[N]
of the empire must have hope.[AN]

[L]
Reverend.[.6] Why did you have us execute[N]
those soldiers?[AN]

[MR]
The livelihood of the people depended on it.[6N]
We took care of these thorns now so we do not[N]
have to later.[AN][Clear]
Would you have preferred that one of these[N]
soldiers laying on the floor hack you to[N]
bits in the future?[AN]

[L]
[Beat][AN]

[MR]
Seeds of doubt may plague you[,] Chiffon.[.6][N]
But you are a mercenary:[.4] bloodshed is something[N]
you are accustomed to[,] correct?[AN]
Not to mention you have an axe to grind[N]
with an imperial commander.[.6] I will[N]
bring you closer to your objective.[AN]

[L]
Yes[Beat] I understand[,] Reverend.[AN]

[MR]
I guide you out of what is best for us.[6N]
Now allow me to lead the way.[AN]
