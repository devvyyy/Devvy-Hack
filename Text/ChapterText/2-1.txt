Psst[,] merc[Beat] 'Thirty minutes late' really[N]

Yes[,] I'm quickly starting to understand his[N]

We gotta save those prisoners and[N]

Who's the prisoner?[.6] This looks to be[N]

Lady Verna's in that cell.[.6] House Kyveli is[N]

Lady Verna is treasured within our Order.[6N]

even beginning to lock up imperial soldiers.[.6][N]
Does that not mark an unwise ruler;[an]
jailing their own subjects?[an]

[MR]

My concern is of a pay raise from the prisoner[N]
uptick rather than maundering.[an]

The people of Aeteria must find hope.[AN]

Reverend.[.6] I'm not sure I'm on the same[N]

The livelihood of the people depended on it.[6N]
We took care of these thorns now so they[N]
would not prick us later.[AN]
Would you have preferred to have been[N]

And you are a mercenary:[.4] bloodshed is[N]
something that you are accustomed to[,][N]
would I be proper to presume?[AN]
Not to mention you have an 'axe to grind'[N]

Huh?![.6] Graham[Beat][.6] Are you out of your[N]

The Liberation army requires a banner to[N]
unite under.[.6] One born with such mystic[N]
theurgy shall do excellently as figurehead.[AN][CSS][MoveRight]

[FR][Yufka]
I must agree.[.6] We have to adapt to the[N]

(The Order set this up already...?)[AN][OpenEyes][C]
What do you intend through making[N]
me the army's figurehead?[AN]

[R]
The people need not a hero[,] Ser.[6N]
They need to believe in a worthy cause.[6N]
Within you is the makings of a hero.[AN]
But all you need to do is fight.[6N]
When the citizens of the empire see[N]
a perfect narrative:[AN]
Imagine.[.6] A seemingly hopeless mercenary[,][N]
suppressed by the empire[,] who fights[N]
to liberate Aeteria[,] despite the odds.[AN]
The heart of the people is yours.[6N]
We will retake Aeteria[,] and you[Beat][N]
You will earn your vengeance.[AN]

[OpenEyes][Beat][AN][CF]

your Order of bloody cultists.[AN]

[FL]
Stay your bow[,] Ilse.[.6] We can't let[N]

Do you see?[.6] Even now[,] we find ourselves[N]

We are like-minded and share a cause[,] yes[,][N]

a leader who brings forth hope.[AN]
To elect a third party such as Ser Chiffon[N]
would reignite the army[Beat] Nay[,][N]
the rebellion itself![AN]

[Beat]I suppose I knew this was coming.[.6][N]
But you really think I'd be a good fit to lead[N]
two armies?[.6] After just a few battles?[AN]

Consider it more like[Beat][.6] one unified army[N]
with a magnitude and power far more than its[N]
parts can amass alone.[AN]
Tell me:[.4] who is better to bring hope to[N]
Aeteria's people than one who rose[N]
from cinders?[AN]
One with powers beyond witchery?[.6][N]
As a mercenary[,] you clearly possess survival[N]
and combat skills.[AN]
And that is even without taking that into[N]
consideration;[.4] you are gifted with[N]
those truly strange powers.[AN]
It would be unwise to refuse this offer:[.4][N]
to lead the liberation of Aeteria is an honor[N]
that would prove most fruitful in time.[AN]

[CloseEyes]I[Beat] I'm not sure if this is the right choice[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]

[FL]
Graham[Beat] I understand that a nomination[N]
from you is almost unheard of[,] but[Beat][N]
You gotta be clear with me.[AN]
I can't judge the lass after one battle[,][N]
but does she have any more to her than[N]
her seemingly uncontrollable powers?[AN]
Can she truly lead an entire army?[.6][N]
Think more about it![.6] I won't let our cause[N]
be felled by some girl you found![AN]

[R]
You ask us:[.4] can one with mystical powers truly[N]
guide us to a new dawn?[.6] That ethos is the[N]
foundation that the Order stands upon.[AN]
We entrust our hopes to one who will lead[N]
us to a new Aeteria.[.6] The people need[N]
the illusions of a hero![AN]

[FL]
Then tell me.[.6] Why her?[.6] Why not the[N]
Minister[,] even?[.6] Someone who's proven[N]
with military commands.[AN]

[R]
We are the leaders of our respective armies.[.6][N]
The Liberation has always been an[N]
uneasy alliance.[AN]
But we are a group of people unified under[N]
the same cause of revolution.[.6] Her[N]
powers are nothing short of miracles.[AN]
We are disgraced[,] you all are unknown.[.6][N]

[ML][Graham][MR][Chiffon][3L]

[MR]
Reverend Graham[,] you look perturbed.[AN]

[ML]
Do not mind me[,] Chiffon.[.6] You may think my[N]
decision sudden or rash[,] but this has been[N]
on my mind for many moons.[AN]
You are Aeteria's light;[.4] her last hope.[.6][N]
If you were to fall[,] I fear the empire may[N]
have no time left.[AN]

[MR]
What do you mean by that?[.6] Actually[,] how[N]
successful have your efforts been thus far[,][N]
with two at the helm?[AN]

[ML]
As of yet[,] our militia has only made dents to[N]
the capital;[.4] small infiltrations for supplies[,][N]
swift skirmishes[,] and an even faster retreat.[AN]

[MR]
You want me with absolute power over[N]
your army.[.6] Why do you trust me?[.6][N]
You don't know anything about me[AN]
or even what I'm capable of.[AN]

[ML]
I know what you're capable of[,] Ser.[.6][N]
And we can be[Beat] creative with your past[,][N]
even if it seems like lunacy.[AN]
Beseech me:[.4] a golden-eyed demon on the[N]
battlefield[,] once thrown away by the empire[Beat][N]
now leads the battle to liberate it.[AN]
We may have made small cracks yet[,] but they[N]
start to show.[.6] The entire country will[N]
know your name.[AN]

[MR]
I'm confident in my battlefield skills[,][N]
but I only know the very basics of statecraft[N]
and tactics.[AN]

[ML]
Here[,] with our numbers[,] what do you propose[N]
as our next course of action?[AN]

[MR]
If we're few in numbers[,] I'd look to recruit.[.6][N]
Many Aeterians are imprisoned below places[N]
we wouldn't even know to look.[AN]

[ML]
Right[Beat] They suffer in cells[,] unilluminated.[.6][N]
You will be the light that saves them[,] bringing[N]
with you a new dawn;[.4] a classic hero narrative.[AN]
Manpower is always a priority[,] Ser.[.6] If we[N]
attempted to overthrow the Aeterian empire[N]
with our current numbers,[AN][C]
it would be tantamount to surrendering[N]
our heads and digging our own graves.[AN]

[MR]
Then[Beat] I think I have an idea[,] even if[N]
it seems a little farfetched.[AN]

[ML]
Elaborate.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat]Perhaps we could turn to the other[N]
side of Ideon for assistance?[AN][Event]

[ML][MoveLeft]

[FL][Raya]
You couldn't possibly mean[Beat] Could we really[N]
turn to the people of Wreyvine for help?[.6][N]
We'd be marked as hostiles on sight.[AN][C]
They'd kill us before we could speak a[N]
single word.[AN]

[MR]
Their forces are grasping for air.[.6] The Duke[N]
claimed Castle Wreyvine and took the King's[N]
life[,] emerging as Emperor of both realms.[AN][C]
We only need to subdue the knights[N]
and somehow combine forces[,] much like[N]
the Order and the Resistance[,] right?[AN]

[FL]
Tsch[Beat] I suppose that's right[Beat][N]
And I'm sure they'll all have a score to[N]
settle with the empire,[AN]
seeing as they're losing yet another war.[AN][C]
The Wreyvians definitely aren't happy with[N]
the Emperor's relentless control on their[N]
lands[,] either.[AN]

[L]
The final call is yours[,] Ser Chiffon.[AN]

[MR]
[Mouth](Yes[,] this should be it...[N]
This is the road to move forward.[N]
Wreyvine is in a state of disarray.[AN]
They hate the empire.)[AN][Mouth][C]
We share a common enemy.[.6] It's not too[n]
unthinkable of a strategy if we can[n]
win over the kingdom's trust[Beat][AN]
We have to get to Wreyvine[,] I'm sure of it.[6N]
If we go through with this plan[,] how many[N]
days would it take us to--[AN]

[L]
I estimate four:[.4] two by water[,] two on foot.[.6][N]
The war has barred the borders that pass[N]
through the sea.[AN]
Our only choice after we reach the crown[N]
city's port is to travel by foot to the[N]
other side of the bridge.[AN]

[FL]
Heh[Beat] Did you already plan the whole[N]
escapade we're venturing towards?[.6] What[,][N]
you lead us to this conclusion?[AN]

[L]
Little more than a few hours ago[,] yes.[6N]
We have little option otherwise[,] akin to[N]
the kingdom.[AN]
Sending messengers ahead of time to[N]
set up a meeting and rendezvous when[N]
we arrive is a worthwhile venture.[AN]

[FL]
Even so[,] this will be a gambit[,] for sure.[.6][N]
Once we reach the bridge[,] there's no[N]
turning back.[AN][C]
I hope you're certain this is the best move.[AN]

[MR]
We're already too far to turn back.[.6][N]
You have all been talking about talking[N]
for days--[.4]I won't disappoint you all.[AN]

[FL]
Show me[,] then.[.6] Everyone here is steeled for[N]
battle.[.6] If you can prove you're truly[N]
worthy to hoist the flag,[AN]
then make me regret my doubts.[AN]

[L]
Henceforth[Beat] Through faith and blood[,] all[N]
will be revealed in due time.[.6][N]
May moonlight guide us.[AN]

[ML]
Oh![.6] Yes[,] Ser Chiffon?[AN]

[MR]
My apologies.[.6] I didn't mean to interrupt[N]
your writing like that.[AN]

[ML]
It is alright[,] Ser.[.6] I am simply summarizing[N]
the latest findings of our chronicles[N]
within the logbook.[AN]

[MR]
Heh[,] with those dog-eared pages and[N]
scribbles within each brim[,] I can tell[N]
this must be a prized possession[,] Minister.[AN]

[ML]
You are correct with your intuition[,] Ser.[.6][N]
This logbook was given to me by my mother[,][N]
many[,] many moons ago.[AN]
It is beyond dear to me.[.6] Now may I ask[N]
you[,] Ser[,] what is that in your hair?[.6][N]
I sense[Beat] magic inside.[AN]

[MR]
It's a ring.[.6] The soul of my greatest[N]
confidant lies within[,] condensed into[N]
the purest ether.[AN]

[ML]
Ah[,] you mean to say that you possess[N]
an etherium[,] Ser?[.6] How rare for a[N]
mercenary to carry one.[AN]

[MR]
Yes.[.6] Everything she stood for--[.4]her[N]
sense of duty[,] her mind and her essence--[.4][N]
is in here.[AN]
When I'm in the thick of things[,] I feel[N]
almost attuned to the ring.[.6] It's almost[N]
like we're still fighting side by side.[AN]

[ML]
Her soul will always be bound to that ring[,][n]
now and always.[.6] The fact that one agreed[N]
to such a pact carries weight as well.[AN]

[MR]
What do you mean[,] Minister?[AN]

[ML]
It means to me that you are one worthy of[N]
trust and power.[.6] I believe the Reverend[N]
was correct in his decision.[AN]

[MR]
Heh.[.6] You really think so?[AN]

[ML]
Captain Raial may not be fully on your side[N]
now[,] but in the battles ahead[,] our[N]

So[,] pup[,] is Chiffon your actual name?[AN]

[MR]
I[Beat] don't know my actual name.[6N]
Like I said[,] I truly have no memory[N]
of my childhood.[AN][C]
Lady Vida called me Chiffon after the[N]
silk of the dress she found me in.[AN]

[ML]
Trust defines the outcome of battle and[N]
forges the strength of armies.[.6] So[N]
how will I learn to trust one whose[AN]
name I don't even know?[AN]

[MR]
We are more than our names alone[,] are[N]
we not?[.6] While I can understand your[N]
caution[,] Captain--[AN]

[ML]
Don't.[.6] I'm not your captain[,] not yet.[AN]

[MR]
Raial[Beat] Listen[,] were I in your shoes I'd[N]
feel the exact same way.[.6] And I'm not quite[N]
sure what the Reverend sees in me[,] either[Beat][AN][C]
But if it means getting a shot at Major[N]
Hayes' head and fixing Aeteria[,] I'm in.[AN]

[ML]
[Beat]Hayes[,] huh?[.6] The Viper?[.6] Aeteria's newest[N]
lapdog?[.6] Got history with him[,] eh?[AN]

[MR]
We crossed blades on the battlefield[,][N]
and I next woke up in a prison cell.[AN]

[ML]
Hm.[.6] Don't let setbacks cloud your vision.[6N]
If you wanna ride with us[,] you'll need[N]
to keep your eyes on the prize ahead.[AN]
We fight to purge the rot from Aeteria[Beat][N]
to right the wrongs of the Emperor and[N]
rebuild the empire.[AN]
It is his mismanagement[,] his neglect[Beat][N]
his obsession with Wreyvian conquest[Beat][N]
that has led to the empire falling into this[AN]
shadow of her former self.[AN]

[MR]
Yeah[,] I saw it with my own eyes.[6N]
Villages going hungry[,] bandits roaming[N]
unchecked[,] corrupt officials[Beat][AN]
This land is bursting at the seams.[6N]
Not to mention the biting cold of the north[N]
reaching down to the empire[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Listen[,] [OpenQuote]Chiffon"[Beat] You'll have to pardon[N]
me for being so cautious off the bat.[6N]
These are my people.[AN]
This little band here[,] we've been through a lot--[.4][N]
countless[,] unimaginable things together[Beat][N]
I just don't want to lose it all.[AN]

I talked to you before.[AN]

[ML]
You must be Ser Chiffon[,] the mercenary[N]
people hold to high esteem for what[N]
I can only assume are trivial reasons.[AN]

[MR]
Oh[,] did I do something to offend?[6N]
I understand the Order and Raial's band[N]
of mercenaries are not on best terms.[AN]

[ML]
Put some respect on the captain's name.[6N]
She is Raial of Vintrus[,] and she will[N]
rescue the empire from injustice.[AN]

[MR]
You must have a lot of faith in her.[6N]
How did you cross paths?[AN]

[ML]
As opposing mercenaries.[.6] I was fighting[N]
under Count Sigrid in the kingdom.[6N]
The Captain was looking for her.[AN]
Said she needed to claim her bounty.[6N]
After everything happened in the kingdom[,][N]
I found myself out of a job.[AN]
The Captain offered me her hand[,][N]
and told me to fight with her.[6N]
I owe it all to her.[AN]

[MR]
Wow[Beat] I can't fathom how one mercenary[N]
could've made such an impact on[N]
so many different people.[AN][C]
With how people speak of her[,] it's[N]
like she's a living legend[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Legend?[.6] Hah[,] can't say that's[N]
entirely inaccurate.[.6] But[,] at the[N]
same time[Beat] If you ask me[Beat][AN]
In my eyes[,] she's just a soul with[N]
a reliable head on her shoulders.[6N]
She knows when to reach out,[AN]
and when to stand firm[Beat][AN]
And she's like a sister to me.[6N]
So if you're really going to lead[N]

I suppose so[Beat] You've got a noble's talent[N]

But your[,] um[,] conduct[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Haha[,] I get that a lot.[.6] Look[,] I've always[N]
been one to be myself[,] no matter what.[6N]
I'd say 'not being noble' is a complement.[AN]
I'm just not the type to remold my manner of[n]

talk and act how I want[,] all else be damned![AN]

[MR]
Heh.[.6] I won't lie[,] your honest spirit does[N]
ease my soul a little.[.6] I kind of hate[N]

So I get the feeling[,] absolutely.[AN]

[ML]
Hey[Beat] I know your eyes are usually glowy and[N]

Eh[,] it's not the strangest thing in the[N]

It's almost as though they become of[N]
Wreyvian blood upon seeing me.[AN]
Afraid of the [OpenQuote]occultic power" that House Kyveli[N]
possesses.[.6] I don't get it[,] but that's[N]
how I found myself with the Order.[AN]
They get it.[.6] Like Yvonne and her sister.[6N]

Do you intend to follow the Order?[AN]

Eh[,] I guess so.[.6] Not much for the[N]

General Opali[,] huh?[.6] That's unlucky.[AN]

That woman is a paradox.[6N]
Her soul is soft as silk[,] yet[N]

It would be more of a mercy for us if[N]

Not the strangest thing that I've seen[N]

You're a mercenary[,] right?[AN]

[ML]
Right on the money.[.6] Well[,] I was an[N]
Imperial soldier.[.6] Emphasis on the [OpenQuote]was".[AN][Smile]

[MR]
Should I ask[,] or[Beat]?[AN]

[ML]
Well[,] you asked by saying that[,] to[N]
be clear.[.6] It was just a small case[N]
of dishonorable discharge[,] eh.[AN]

You seem almost proud of that.[AN]

If I may[,] Ser Chiffon.[.6] I find that[N]
your powers are[Beat][.6] reminiscent of the[N]
Silver Serpent herself.[AN]
Your golden eyes and your bright hair lead[N]
me to thinking you carry divine blood.[AN]

[MR]
You really think so?[.6] I don't know much[N]
about this whole magical business[,] but I[N]
think that you may be overthinking things.[AN]
Anyways[,] mind if I ask something about[N]
you?[.6] You're an exile from the Imperial[N]
court[,] right?[AN]

[ML]
Nay[,] Ser.[.6] I left voluntarily.[.6] I was[N]
tired of the constant bickering[,] the non-stop[N]
schemes at play[,] and feeling like I[AN]
was simply a pawn to a larger game.[AN]
The tattoos symbolize my faith;[.4] not just[N]
of the Silver Serpent[,] but to those farther[N]
from Ideon--[.4]the chthonic and the fallen.[AN]

[MR]
Wait[,] there's really more than just the[N]
Ideonian Twins?[AN]

[ML]
It isn't commonly taught[,] yes.[.6] There's[N]
the twin gods--[.4]the Iron Tusks of Wreyvine[,][N]
and the Silver Serpent of Aeteria.[AN]
And another Ideonian god--[.4]no[,] merely an[n]
entity with many names[Beat] They call[n]
him the Harbinger.[AN]
The Primordial One;[.4] the Ashen Rider.[.6][N]
When the scales of the world are tipped[,][N]
he brings forth an eternal winter.[AN][C]
Upon his ebon steed[,] yes[Beat] He is the[N]
bitter cold[,] consuming all.[AN]

[MR]
So[,] then[Beat] Do you think[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Yes.[.6] I believe that the divine senses the[N]
world's injustice.[.6] The people's sins have[N]
called down divine retribution from the gods.[AN]
Have you not noticed the state of Wreyvine?[.6][N]
Crops in the kingdom freeze.[.6] When the[N]
kingdom's vast game and fish decline,[AN]
the people will begin to starve in[N]
the north.[.6] It is only a matter of time[N]
before the empire falls like Wreyvine.[AN]

Divine retribution?[.6] Oh[,] that wasn't[N]
where I was going at all.[.6] Velius[,] how[N]
we stop this [OpenQuote]Harbinger"?[AN]

They are simply statements[,] Ser.[6N]
You lent your blade to us[,] so now[N]

When the emperor is out of the picture.[6N]
When the true proper ruler takes their[N]
place upon the Aeterian throne.[AN]

[ML]
Reverend[Beat] who was it that sold[N]
out our Order out to the Emperor?[6N]
Surely it was not one of our own?[AN]

[MR]
I can imagine no one else but[N]
Councilman Anton[,] Minister.[AN]

[ML]
Anton[,] that rat[Beat] I had a feeling[N]
he was up to something[,] but[Beat]

[MR]
Even without him[,] this was inevitable.[6N]
Selwyn's birthright meant he had[N]
far too much sway within the Court.[AN]

[ML]
I just despise it[Beat] Perhaps[,] had we been[N]
more proactive[Beat] Had we recognized[N]
Selwyn's incompetence earlier[Beat][AN]
I dream of what could've been[Beat] Had we[N]

Maybe we could've prevented all[N]
of this from coming to light.[AN]

[MR]
Perhaps we could have indeed.[6N]
But this is the hand we were dealt.[6N]
Still[,] it was a boon in some ways.[AN]
In villainizing us for opposing him[,][N]
the Emperor unwillingly depicted[N]
himself as a self-centered tyrant.[AN]
The people are losing faith in him[,][N]
slowly but surely.[.6] And I have yet[N]
greater plans for us.[AN]

[ML]
Yet nobody dares speak out against[N]
him now--[.4]and especially not to[N]
his face.[AN]
In fact[,] I hear the emperor's tolerance[N]
for disobedience has grown even[N]
thinner since we left the court.[AN]
There are many voices of dissent[N]
among the Aeterian ranks[,] yet few[N]
speak loud enough to be heard.[AN]

[MR]
I had noticed that as well[,] Minister.[6N]
As a matter of fact[,] that's exactly[N]
how this plan came together[Beat][AN]
If we can embolden the people[N]
