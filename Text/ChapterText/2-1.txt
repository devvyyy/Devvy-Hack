Who's the prisoner?[.6] This looks to be[N]

they must be quite valued.[AN]

Lady Verna's in that cell.[.6] House Kyveli is[N]
known for its occultic spells[,] so it[N]
must be heavily guarded.[AN]

Lady Verna is treasured within our Order.[6N]

Officer Alair[,] suspicious activity was detected[N]
in the lower levels of the prison.[6] It seems[N]
these are not part of the same[AN]
group of rebels that are causing a[N]
ruckus at the crown city.[an]

[MR]
A group of rebels have decided to rise and[n]
"liberate" this imperial prison?[6] Bah![6n]
What nonsense![an]

[ML]
Officer Alair[,] what would you have us do?[6n]
[Pause]Even if I think I know your answer.[an]

[MR]
It is just another group of rebels[,] is it not?[6n]
If they intend to intrude and disturb[n]
the peace[Beat][AN][C]
Then I am afraid we have no choice but[N]
to respond in kind.[an]

Surely we have more important matters[n]
to attend to than to guard a few[n]
random cells.[AN]
Who cares about the disgraced noble?[6n]
Let them all rot in there[,] for the[N]
Serpent's sake[Beat][AN]

[MR]
I have never seen the prison as full as it[n]
is now... The army must be carrying out[N]
extensive incarcerations around Aeteria.[an][C]
I fear the Emperor must be in his cups[N]
to have come up such a measure.[an]

[ML]
Looks like the case to me.[6] I hear they're[N]
even beginning to lock up imperial soldiers.[.6][N]
Does that not mark an unwise ruler;[an]
jailing their own subjects?[an]

[MR]
Yet[Beat] Who are we to decide such things?[6N]
My concern is of a pay raise from the prisoner[N]
uptick rather than maundering.[an]

[ML]
I'd be lying if I wasn't thinking the[n]

really make him an unwise ruler?[an][C]
Not raising our wages after giving us so[n]

Especially considering the circumstances[,][N]
Ser Chiffon[,] you handled your duties[N]

As a hypothetical[,] what do you propose we[N]

[FL][MoveLeft]
[CloseEyes](There's definitely a right answer...)[AN][Clear][OpenEyes]
This is the deepest part of the prison.[6n][OpenEyes]
Once we leave[,] you want us to regroup and[N]
strike against the empire.[AN]
I presume you have a hideout nearby.[6N]
We'll go back to that place and prepare[N]
ourselves for tomorrow's battles.[AN]

[R]
A perfect response.[.6] We shall regroup with[N]
Captain Raial and the rest of her[N]
Resistance mercenaries.[AN]
They reside in the quiet village of Arma.[AN]
That will be our sanctum before we begin[N]
our attack on the capital city.[AN][Event]

Capital city?![.6] Your rebellion starts at[N]
the heart of the people?[AN]

Yes.[.6] That is the first target.[.6] The people[N]
of the empire must find hope.[AN]

[L]
Reverend.[.6] I'm not sure I'm on the same[N]
page.[.6] Why did you have us execute[N]
those soldiers?[AN]

[R]
The livelihood of the people depended on it.[6N]
We took care of these thorns now so we[N]
must not have to later.[AN]
Would you have preferred to have been[N]
caught[,] impaled by one of these[N]

Seeds of doubt may plague you[,] Chiffon.[.6][N]
But doubt is the first step towards the[N]

And you are a mercenary:[.4] bloodshed is[N]
something that you are accustomed to[,][N]
would I be proper to presume?[AN]
Not to mention you have an 'axe to grind'[N]

Will you lead the Aeterian Liberation army?[AN][Event]

[FL][MFL]
Huh?![.6] Graham[Beat][.6] Are you out of your[N]

The Liberation army requires a banner to[N]
unite under.[.6] One born with such mystic[N]
theurgy shall do excellently as figurehead.[AN][CSS][MoveRight]

[FR][Yufka]
I must agree.[.6] We have to adapt to the[N]
current situation if we want any hope[N]
to win this war.[AN]
I hear the Imperial troops speak in fear[N]
of a gold-eyed mercenary who sparks[N]
with strange powers.[AN]

[L][CloseEyes]
(The Order set this up already...?)[AN][OpenEyes][C]
What do you intend through making[N]
me the army's figurehead?[AN]

[R]
The people need not a hero[,] Ser.[6N]
They need to believe in a worthy cause.[6N]
Within you is the makings of a hero.[AN]
But all you need to do is fight.[6N]
When the citizens of the empire see[N]
a perfect narrative:[AN]
a seemingly hopeless mercenary[,][N]
suppressed by the empire[,] who fights[N]
to liberate Aeteria[,] despite the odds.[AN]
The heart of the people is yours.[6N]
We will retake Aeteria[,] and you[Beat][N]
You will earn your vengeance.[AN]

[L]
[OpenEyes][Beat][AN][CF]

[L][Ilse]
Such foolishness.[.6] I won't allow such folly[N]
from one of the Order--[.4]a cultist[N]
dares to lecture the Captain![AN]

[FL]
Stay your bow[,] Ilse.[.6] We can't let[N]
in-fighting plague the liberation effort[,][N]
even if I'm dealing with mooncalves.[AN]

[R]
Do you see?[.6] Even now[,] we find ourselves[N]
split between those of the Order and[N]
those with the Resistance[Beat][AN]
We are like-minded and share a cause[,] yes[,][N]
but[Beat] It is clear that we need[N]
a leader who brings forth hope.[AN]
To elect a third party such as Ser Chiffon[N]
would reignite the army[Beat] Nay[,][N]
the rebellion itself![AN]

[L][CF][Chiffon]
[Beat]I suppose I knew this was coming.[.6][N]
But you really think I'd be a good fit to lead[N]
two armies?[.6] After just a few battles?[AN]

[R]
Consider it more like[Beat][.6] one combined army[N]
with a magnitude and power far more than a[N]
singular force.[AN]
Tell me:[.4] who is better to bring hope to[N]
Aeteria's people than one who rose[N]
from nothing?[AN]
One with powers beyond witchery?[.6][N]
As a mercenary[,] you clearly possess survival[N]
and combat skills.[AN]
And that is even without taking that into[N]
consideration;[.4] you are gifted with[N]
those truly strange powers.[AN]
It would be unwise to refuse this offer:[.4][N]
to lead the liberation of Aeteria is an honor[N]
that would prove most fruitful in time.[AN]

[L]
[CloseEyes]I[Beat] I'm not sure if this is the right choice[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]

[FL]
Graham[Beat] I understand that a nomination[N]
from you is almost unheard of[,] but[Beat][N]
You gotta be clear with me.[AN]
I can't judge the lass after one battle[,][N]
but does she have any more to her than[N]
her seemingly uncontrollable powers?[AN]
Can she truly lead an entire army?[.6][N]
Think more about it![.6] I won't let our cause[N]
be felled by some girl you found![AN]

[R]
You ask us:[.4] can one with mystical powers truly[N]
guide us to a new dawn?[.6] That ethos is the[N]
foundation that the Order stands upon.[AN][C]
We entrust our hopes to one who will lead[N]
us to a new Aeteria.[.6] The people need[N]
the illusions of a hero.[AN]

[FL]
Tell me.[.6] Why her?[.6] Why not the[N]
Minister[,] even?[AN]

[R]
We are the leaders of our respective armies.[.6][N]
The Liberation has always been an[N]
uneasy alliance.[AN]
But we are a group of people unified under[N]
the same cause of revolution.[.6] Her[N]
powers are nothing short of miracles.[AN]
We are disgraced[,] you all are unknown.[.6][N]
It only makes sense for a neutral--[.4][N]
an esteemed mercenary--[.4]to lead us.[AN]

[FL]
Kid[,] how long have you fought?[.6] I've never[N]
seen one wield twin crossbows like that.[.6][N]
Who taught ya how to shoot?[AN]

[L][OpenEyes]
Raial[Beat][.6] None have taught me.[.6] I have no clue[n]
where I come from[,] but ever since Lady Vida[N]
picked me up[,] I taught myself the basics.[AN]

[FL]
Tsch[,] not bad.[.6] But are you ready for more?[.6][N]
Will you be able to bring a better world[N]
for Aeteria?[.6] Will you resist giving in?[AN]

[L]
Never.[.6] I will never quit until the Emperor[N]
is dead by my hands.[AN]

[FL]
Chiffon[,] tell us all--[.4]tell us all about how you'll[N]
lead the militia.[.6] Show me the fire in[N]
your heart![.6] How will you succeed?![AN]
'Cause Graham[Beat] I sure as hell am not letting a[N]
stranger you met yesterday decide the fate[N]
of the empire![AN]

[L]
Lady Vida taught me all about warfare.[6N]
She knew nothing of shooting[,] but that[N]
woman had a calculating mind.[AN]
I have slain many from brigands to Imperial[N]
soldiers.[.6] Only Major Hayes could stop[N]
me[,] and I intend on getting him back.[AN]
I've fought in many battles in my time as[N]
a mercenary.[.6] I'll make sure to do everything[N]
in my power to lead us to a new dawn.[AN]

[Pause]I'll make my judgements when I see you[N]

Ser.[.6] It would do the militia well for you to[N]
discuss our road ahead with everyone.[.6] I have[N]
gathered a few other faces of the army.[N][C]
Introduce yourself and your newfound role in[N]
Aeteria's liberation.[AN]

[L]
Raial.[.6] You may not have faith in me yet[,][N]
but I will get us through this.[.6] I will[N]
earn your trust and respect.[AN]

What is coming up will be paramount to the[N]
Liberation.[.6] Make sure you prepare and reflect[N]

Reverend Graham[,] you look perturbed.[AN]

[ML]
Do not mind me[,] Chiffon.[.6] You may think my[N]
decision sudden or rash[,] but this has been[N]
on my mind for many moons.[AN]
You are Aeteria's light;[.4] her last hope.[.6][N]
If you were to fall[,] I fear the empire may[N]
have no time left.[AN]

[MR]
What do you mean by that?[.6] Actually[,] how[N]
successful have your efforts been thus far[,][N]
with two atthe helm?[AN]

[ML]
As of yet[,] our militia has only made dents to[N]
the capital;[.4] small infiltrations for supplies[,][N]
swift skirmishes[,] and an even faster retreat.[AN]

[MR]
You want me with absolute power over[N]
your army.[.6] Why do you trust me?[.6][N]
You don't know anything about me[AN]
or even what I'm capable of.[AN]

[ML]
I know what you're capable of[,] Ser.[.6][N]
And we can be[Beat] creative with your past[,][N]
even if it seems like lunacy.[AN]
Beseech me:[.4] a golden-eyed demon on the[N]
battlefield[,] once thrown away by the empire[Beat][N]
now leads the battle to liberate it.[AN]
We may have made small cracks yet[,] but they[N]
start to show.[.6] The entire country will[N]
know your name.[AN]

[MR]
I'm confident in my battlefield skills[,][N]
but I only know the very basics of statecraft[N]

[ML]
Here[,]with our numbers[,] what do you propose[N]
as our next course of action?[AN]

[MR]
If we're few in numbers[,] I'd look to recruit.[.6][N]
Many Aeterians are imprisoned below places[N]
we wouldn't even know to look.[AN]

[ML]
Right[Beat] They suffer in cells[,] unilluminated.[.6][N]
You will be the light that saves them[,] bringing[N]
with you a new dawn;[.4] a classic hero narrative.[AN]
Manpower is always a priority[,] Ser.[.6] If we[N]
attempted to overthrow the Aeterian empire[N]
with our current numbers,[AN][C]
it would be tantamount to surrendering[N]
our heads and digging our own graves.[AN]

[MR]
Then[Beat] I think I have an idea[,] even if[N]
it seems a little farfetched.[AN]

[ML]
Elaborate.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat]Perhaps we could turn to the other[N]
side of Ideon for assistance?[AN][Event]

[ML][MoveLeft]

[FL][Raya]
You couldn't possibly mean[Beat] Could we really[N]
turn to the people of Wreyvine for help?[.6][N]
We'd be marked as hostiles on sight.[AN][C]
They'd kill us before we could speak a[N]
single word.[AN]

[MR]
Their forces are grasping for air.[.6] The Duke[N]
claimed Castle Wreyvine and took the King's[N]
life[,] emerging as Emperor of both realms.[AN][C]
We only need to subdue the knights[N]
and somehow combine forces[,] much like[N]
the Order and the Resistance[,] right?[AN]

[FL]
Tsch[Beat] I suppose that's right[Beat][N]
And I'm sure they'll all have a score to[N]
settle with the empire,[AN]
seeing as they're losing yet another war.[AN][C]
The Wreyvians definitely aren't happy with[N]
the Emperor's relentless control on their[N]
lands[,] either.[AN]

The final call is yours[,] Ser Chiffon.[AN]

[MR]
[Mouth](Yes, this should be it...[N]
This is the road to move forward.[N]
Wreyvine is in a state of disarray.[AN]
They hate the empire.)[AN][Mouth][C]
We share a common enemy.[.6] It's not too[n]
unthinkable of a strategy If we can[n]
win over the kingdom's trust[Beat][AN]
We have to get to Wreyvine[,] I'm sure of it.[6N]
If we go through with this plan[,] how many[N]
days would it take us to--[AN]

[L]
I estimate four:[.4] two by water[,] two on foot.[.6][N]
The war has barred the borders that pass[N]
through the sea.[AN][C]
Our only choice after we reach the crown[N]
city's port is to travel by foot to the[N]
other side of the bridge.[AN]

[FL]
Heh[Beat] Did you already plan the whole[N]
escapade we're venturing towards?[.6] What[,][N]
you lead us to this conclusion?[AN]

[L]
Little more than a few hours ago[,] yes.[6N]
We have little option otherwise[,] akin to[N]
the kingdom.[AN]

[FL]
Even so[,] this will be a gambit[,]for sure.[.6][N]
Once we reach the bridge[,] there's no[N]
turning back.[AN][C]
I hope you're certain this is the best move.[AN]

[MR]
We're already too far to turn back.[.6][N]
You have all been talking about talking[N]
for days--[.4]I won't disappoint you all.[AN]

[ML]
Oh![.6] Yes[,] Ser Chiffon?[AN]

[MR]
My apologies.[.6] I didn't mean to interrupt[N]
your writing like that.[AN]

[ML]
It is alright[,] Ser.[.6] I am simply summarizing[N]
the latest findings of our chronicles[N]
within the logbook.[AN]

[MR]
Heh[,] with those dog-eared pages and[N]
scribbles within each brim[,] I can tell[N]
this must be a prized possession[,] Minister.[AN]

[ML]
You are correct with your intuition[,] Ser.[.6][N]
This logbook was given to me by my mother[,][N]
many[,] many moons ago.[AN]
It is beyond dear to me.[.6] Now may I ask[N]
you[,] Ser[,] what is that in your hair?[.6][N]
I sense[Beat] magic inside.[AN]

[MR]
It's a ring.[.6] The soul of my greatest[N]
confidant lies within[,] condensed into[N]
the purest ether.[AN]

[ML]
Ah[,] you mean to say that you possess[N]
an etherium[,] Ser?[.6] How rare for a[N]
mercenary to carry one.[AN]

[MR]
Yes.[.6] Everything she stood for--[.4]her[N]
sense of duty[,] her mind and her essence--[.4][N]
is in here.[AN]
When I'm in the thick of things[,] I feel[N]
almost attuned to the ring.[.6] It's almost[N]
like we're still fighting side by side.[AN]

[ML]
Her soul will always be bound to that ring[,][n]
now and always.[.6] The fact that one agreed[N]
to such a pact carries weight as well.[AN]

[MR]
What do you mean[,] Minister?[AN]

[ML]
It means to me that you are one worthy of[N]
trust and power.[.6] I believe the Reverend[N]
was correct in his decision.[AN]

Captain Raial may not be fully on your side[N]

Hm.[.6] Do not let that cloud your vision.[6N]

to keep your eyes on the prize ahead.[AN]
We fight to purge the rot from Aeteria[Beat][N]
to right the wrongs of the Emperor and[N]
rebuild the empire.[AN]
It is his mismanagement[,] his neglect[Beat][N]
his obsession with Wreyvian conquest[Beat][N]
that has led to the empire falling into this[AN]
shadow of her former self.[AN]

[MR]
Yeah[,]I saw it with my own eyes.[6N]

But your[,] um[,] conduct[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Haha[,] I get that a lot.[.6] Look[,] I've always[N]

Skirmish gone wrong.[.6] We launched[N]
an attack on a supply outpost.[6N]
Didn't realize General Opali was there.[AN]

[MR]
General Opali[,] huh?[.6] That's unlucky.[AN]

[ML]
That woman is a paradox.[6N]
Her soul is soft as silk[,] yet[N]

She subdued us with little effort[Beat][N]

I cannot fathom her line of thinking.[AN]

[MR]
I see[Beat] I hear she was quite the brutal fighter[N]
back in the old war.[AN]

[ML]
You'd think someone like her would realize the[N]
hypocrisy of it all.[.6] Serving a regime of lies[N]
like Selwyn's,[AN]
under the pretense of [OpenQuote]mercy"?[AN][C]
It would be more of a mercy for us if[N]

When the scales of the world are tipped[,][N]

Upon his ebon steed[,] yes[Beat] He is the[N]
bitter cold[,] consuming all.[AN]

[MR]
So[,] then[Beat] Do you think[Beat][AN]

Yes.[.6] I believe that the divine senses the[N]
