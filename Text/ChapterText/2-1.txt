[MR]
So[Beat] What got you in this mess?[6N] You think[N]
we’re gonna rot in the slammer for the rest[N]
of our days?

[ML]
Rest of our days?[.6] And I thought we were sentenced[N]
to death.[.6] They cannot even grant us that mercy?[6N]
They were rounding up villagers in Drisvelg.[AN][Clear]
I was just a humble vagrant, but it seems[N]
my luck ran out...[AN]

[MR]
How wretched.[AN]

[ML]
And you?[.6] What brings you to our lovely confinement?[AN]

[MR]
Well.[.6] I’m a noble who opposes the Duke, so he[N]
wanted me dead.[AN]

[ML]
Royalty[,] eh?[.6] Say, is there anything I can do[N]
to assist?[.6] How about a pirouette?[AN]

[MR]
I would rather die.[AN]

[ML]
[Beat][MoveMidLeft][AN]

[MR]
Actually[,] cellmate[,] can you play something on[N]
that lyre of yours?[AN]

[ML]
The gittern[,] you mean? Why, yes...[AN]

[ML]
Just thirty minutes behind schedule.[6N]
That is adequate considering the territory.[AN]

[MR][MoveRight][FR][LoadJaye]
[FR]
Psst, merc[Beat] 'Thirty minutes late' really[N]
means an hour from the Reverend.[AN]

[R]
Yes[,] I’m quickly starting to understand his[N]
eccentricities[Beat] Ah[,] Reverend.[.6] This is the[N]
deepest floor of the prison[,] right?[AN][Clear]
And we gotta save those prisoners and escape.[AN]

[ML]
You are correct once again[,] Ser Chiffon.[6N]
I am so glad our faith in you was not[N]
misguided thus far.[AN]

[FR]
There are two prisoners in that cell.[6N]
What do you propose we do?

[E]
Who are these two prisoners?[.6] This looks to be the maximum[N]
security area down here—they must be dangerous[N]
prisoners--[.4]or at least worth a price.[AN]

[ML][MoveFarLeft][L][LoadYufka]
Verna is a treasured member of our Order.[6N]
She was a noble to Aeteria--[.4]her betrayal of the[N]
throne and her occultic magic must have[AN]
marked her as an important target.[AN][Clear]
The other[Beat] [Beat] do not know who he is.[6N]
Some[Beat] minstrel?[AN]

[MR]
Got it.[.6] So we’ll break them out and get[N]
out of this ruddy place[,] no one left behind.[AN]

Officer Alair, suspicious activity was detected right at the lower levels of the prison. It seems these are not part of the same group of rebels that are causing a ruckus at the crown city.

Alair (from Fire Emblem: Engage)
So, a group of rebels have decided to “liberate” this imperial prison yet again? Bah! What garbage!

Generic Soldier Guy
Officer Alair, what would you have us do? Hold on. I think I know your answer.

Alair (from Fire Emblem: Engage)
It is just another group of rebels, is it not? If they intend to intrude and disturb the peace, then we respond with force.

Generic Soldier Guy
Surely we have more important matters to do than to guard a few damned cells. Who cares about the noble? Let her rot in there, for Serpent’s sake... Let the silly fool inside play elegies'til they depart!

Alair (from COTA?!??!?!/1/1/1). 
I have never seen the prison as full as it is now... The army must be going around and jailing many all of a sudden. The Duke must be in his cups...

Generic Soldier Guy
Looks like the case to me. I hear they’re even jailing imperial soldiers. Does that not seem like the mark of an unwise ruler, jailing their own subjects?

Alair (from Fire Emblem: Infinite Kings)
Meh, who are we to decide such things? I’m more concerned about getting a pay raise because of the prisoner uptick than things like that.

Generic Soldier Guy
I’d be lying if I wasn’t thinking the same thing, Officer. You know what would really make him an unwise ruler? Not raising our wages after giving us so many men to manage!
