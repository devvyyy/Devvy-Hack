[MR]
So[Beat] What got you in this mess?[6N]
You think we’ll just rot in a cell for[N]
the rest of our days?[AN]

[ML]
Rest of our days?[.6] And I thought we were sentenced[N]
to death.[.6] They cannot even grant us that mercy?[6N]
They were rounding up villagers in Drisvelg.[AN][Clear]
I was just a humble vagrant, but it seems[N]
my luck ran out[...][AN]

[MR]
How wretched.[AN]

[ML]
And you?[.6] What brings you to our lovely confinement?[AN]

[MR]
Well.[.6] I’m a noble who opposes the Duke, so he[N]
wanted me dead.[AN]

[ML]
Royalty[,] eh?[.6] Say, is there anything I can do[N]
to assist?[.6] How about a pirouette?[AN]

[MR]
I would rather die.[AN]

[ML]
[Beat][MoveMidLeft][AN]

[MR]
Actually[,] cellmate[,] can you play something on[N]
that lyre of yours?[AN]

[ML]
The gittern[,] you mean?[.6] Why[,] yes[Beat][AN]

[ML][LoadGraham][MR][LoadChiffon]

[ML]
Just thirty minutes behind schedule.[6N]
That is adequate considering the territory.[AN]

[MR][MoveRight][FR][LoadJaye]
[FR]
Psst, merc[Beat] 'Thirty minutes late' really[N]
means an hour from the Reverend.[AN]

[R]
Yes[,] I’m quickly starting to understand his[N]
eccentricities[Beat] Ah[,] Reverend.[.6] This is the[N]
deepest floor of the prison[,] right?[AN][Clear]
And we gotta save those prisoners and escape.[AN]

[ML]
You are correct once again[,] Ser Chiffon.[6N]
I am so glad our faith in you was not[N]
misguided thus far.[AN]

[FR]
There are two prisoners in that cell.[6N]
What do you propose we do?

[E]
Who are these two prisoners?[.6] This looks to be the maximum[N]
security area down here—they must be dangerous[N]
prisoners--[.4]or at least worth a price.[AN]

[ML][MoveFarLeft][L][LoadYufka]
Verna is a treasured member of our Order.[6N]
She was a noble to Aeteria--[.4]her betrayal of the[N]
throne and her occultic magic must have[AN]
marked her as an important target.[AN][Clear]
The other[Beat] [Beat] do not know who he is.[6N]
Some[Beat] minstrel?[AN]

[MR]
Got it.[.6] So we’ll break them out and get[N]
out of this ruddy place[,] no one left behind.[AN]

[ML][LoadSoldier][MR][LoadAlair]
[ML]
Officer Alair, suspicious activity was detected[N]
in the lower levels of the prison.[6] It seems[N]
these are not part of the same group of rebels[an]
that are causing a ruckus at the crown city.[an]

[MR]
A group of rebels have decided to rise and[n]
“liberate” this imperial prison?[6] Bah![6n]
What nonsense![an]

[ML]
Officer Alair[,] what would you have us do?[6n]
[Pause]Even if I think I know your answer.[an]

[MR]
It is just another group of rebels, is it not?[6n]
If they intend to intrude and disturb the peace[,][n]
then we have no choice but to respond with force.[an]

[ML]
Surely we have more important matters to attend[n]
to than to guard a few damned cells.[6n]
Who cares about the disgraced noble?[an]
Let them rot in there[,] for the Serpent’s sake...[6n]
Let the silly fool inside play elegies'til[n]
they both depart.[an]

[MR]
I have never seen the prison as full as it[n]
is now... The army must be carrying out extensive[n]
incarcerations around Aeteria.[an]
I fear the Emperor must be in his cups...[an]

[ML]
Looks like the case to me.[6] I hear they’re even
locking up imperial soldiers.[.6] Does that not
mark an unwise ruler;[an]
jailing their own subjects?[an]

[MR]
Meh, who are we to decide such things? I’m[n]
more concerned about getting a pay raise from[n]
the prisoner uptick than maunder like that.[an]

[ML]
I’d be lying if I wasn’t thinking the[n]
same thing, Officer.[6] You know what would[n]
really make him an unwise ruler?[an]
Not raising our wages after giving us so[n]
many men to manage![an]
