Who's the prisoner?[.6] This looks to be the maximum[N]

Lady Verna's in that cell.[.6] House Kyveli is[N]

Lady Verna is treasured within our Order.[6N]

Officer Alair[,] suspicious activity was detected[N]
in the lower levels of the prison.[6] It seems[N]
these are not part of the same[AN]
group of rebels that are causing a[N]
ruckus at the crown city.[an]

[MR]
A group of rebels have decided to rise and[n]
"liberate" this imperial prison?[6] Bah![6n]
What nonsense![an]

[ML]
Officer Alair[,] what would you have us do?[6n]
[Pause]Even if I think I know your answer.[an]

[MR]
It is just another group of rebels[,] is it not?[6n]
If they intend to intrude and disturb[n]
the peace[Beat][AN][C]
Then I am afraid we have no choice but[N]
to respond in kind.[an]

Surely we have more important matters[n]

Who cares about the disgraced noble?[6n]
Let them all rot in there[,] for the[N]
Serpent's sake[Beat][AN]

[MR]
I have never seen the prison as full as it[n]
is now... The army must be carrying out[N]
extensive incarcerations around Aeteria.[an][C]
I fear the Emperor must be in his cups[N]
to have come up such a measure.[an]

[ML]
Looks like the case to me.[6] I hear they're[N]
even beginning to lock up imperial soldiers.[.6][N]
Does that not mark an unwise ruler;[an]
jailing their own subjects?[an]

[MR]
Yet[Beat] Who are we to decide such things?[6N]
My concern is of a pay raise from the prisoner[N]
uptick rather than maundering.[an]

I'd be lying if I wasn't thinking the[n]

Captain Raial and the rest of her[N]

They reside in the quiet village of Arma.[AN]
That will be our sanctum before we begin[N]
our attack on the crown city.[AN][Event]

Yes.[.6] That is the first target.[.6] The people[N]

[L]
Reverend.[.6] I'm not sure I'm on the same[N]

The livelihood of the people depended on it.[6N]
We took care of these thorns now so we[N]

Would you have preferred to have been[N]

Huh?![.6] Graham[Beat][.6] Are you out of your damned mind?![AN]

The Liberation army needs a banner to unite under.[.6][N]
One born with such mystic theurgy shall do[N]

I must agree.[.6] We have to adapt to the current situation.[.6][N]

(The Order set this up already...?)[AN][OpenEyes][C]
What do you intend through making[N]
me the army's figurehead?[AN]

[R]
The people need not a hero[,] Ser.[6N]
They need to believe in a worthy cause.[6N]
Within you is the makings of a hero.[AN]
But all you need to do is fight.[6N]
When the citizens of the empire see[N]
a perfect narrative:[AN]
a seemingly hopeless mercenary[,][N]
suppressed by the empire[,] who fights[N]

The heart of the people is yours.[6N]
We will retake Aeteria[,] and you[Beat][N]

Such foolishness.[.6] I won't take that from one of[N]

lecture the Captain![AN]

[FL]
Stay your bow[,] Ilse.[.6] We can't allow in-fighting to[N]
plague the liberation effort.[AN]

[R]
Even here[,] we're split between members of the Order[N]

a cause[,] yes[,] but[Beat][AN]
It is clear that we need a leader.[.6] To elect a third[N]
party such as Ser Chiffon would reignite the army.[6n]
Nay[,] the entirety of the rebellion itself![AN]

[L][CF][Chiffon]
[Beat]I suppose I knew this was coming.[.6][N]
But you really think I'd be a good fit to lead[N]
two armies?[.6] After just a few battles?[AN]

[R]
Consider it more like[Beat][.6] one combined army[N]
with a magnitude and power far more than a[N]
singular force.[AN]
Tell me:[.4] who is better to bring hope to[N]
Aeteria's people than one who rose[N]
from nothing?[AN]
One with powers beyond witchery?[.6][N]
As a mercenary[,] you clearly possess survival[N]
and combat skills.[AN]
Without taking that into consideration gifted[N]
with those truly strange powers[N]
of yours.[AN]
It would be unwise to refuse this offer:[.4][N]
to lead the liberation of Aeteria is an honor[N]
that would prove most fruitful in time.[AN]

[L]
[CloseEyes]I[Beat] I'm not sure if this is the right choice[Beat][AN]

[FL]
Graham[Beat] I understand that a nomination from you is[N]
almost unheard of[,] but[Beat] But does the lass have[N]
anymore than her seemingly uncontrollable powers?[AN]
Can she truly lead an entire army?[.6][N]
Think more about it![.6] I won't let our cause[N]
be felled by some girl you found![AN]

[R]
You ask us:[.4] can one with mystical powers truly[N]
guide us to a new dawn?[.6] That ethos is the[N]
foundation that the Order stands upon.[AN][C]
We entrust our hopes to one who will lead[N]
us to a new Aeteria.[AN]

[FL]
Tell me.[.6] Why her?[.6] Why not Yufka[,] even?[AN]

[R]
We are the leaders of our respective armies--[.4]the[N]
Liberation has always been an uneasy alliance[Beat][N]
to say the least.[AN]
But we are a group of people unified under the[N]
same cause of revolution.[.6] It is clear that we[N]
need one to unify us.[AN]
We are disgraced[,] you all are unknown.[.6][N]
It only makes sense for a neutral--[.4][N]
an esteemed mercenary--[.4]to lead us.[AN]

[FL]
Kid[,] how long have you fought?[.6] I've never seen[N]
one wield twin crossbows like that.[.6][N]
Who taught ya how to shoot?[AN]

[L]
Raial[Beat][.6] None have taught me.[.6] I have no clue[n]
where I come from[,] but ever since Lady Vida picked[N]
me up[,] I taught myself the basics of shooting.[AN]

[FL]
Tsch[,] not bad.[.6] But are you ready for more?[.6][N]
Will you be able to bring a better world for Aeteria?[.6][N]
Will you ever resist giving in?[AN]

[L]
Never.[.6] I will never quit until the Emperor[N]
is dead by my hands.[AN]

[FL]
Chiffon[,] tell us all--[.4]tell us all about how you'll[N]
lead the militia.[.6] Tell me how you'll succeed[,][N]
what you can do[,] and how you won't let us down.[AN]
'Cause Graham[Beat] I sure as hell am not letting a[N]
stranger you met yesterday decide the fate[N]
of the empire![AN]

[L]
Lady Vida taught me all about warfare.[6N]
She knew nothing of shooting[,] but that[N]
woman had a calculating mind.[AN]
I've fought in many battles in my time as[N]
a mercenary.[.6] I'll make sure to do everything[N]
in my power to lead us to a new dawn.[AN]

of the Imperial court[Beat][AN]

I owe her everything[,] Minister.[.6] I wouldn't[N]

[R]
Ser.[.6] It would do the militia well for you to[N]
discuss our road ahead with everyone.[.6] Introduce[N]
yourself and your role in Aeteria's liberation.[AN]

[L]
Raial.[.6] You may not have faith in me yet[,][N]
but I will get us through this.[.6] I will[N]
earn your trust and respect.[AN]

[MR]
Reverend Graham[,] you look perturbed.[AN]

[ML]
Do not mind me[,] Chiffon.[.6] You may think my[N]
decision sudden or rash[,] but I have been thinking of[N]
appointing a leader for many moons.[AN]
You are Aeteria's light;[.4] her last hope.[.6][N]
If you were to fall[,] I fear the empire may[N]
have no time left.[AN]

[MR]
What do you mean by that?[.6] Actually[,] how successful[N]
have your efforts been thus far[,] with two at[N]
the helm?[AN]

[ML]
As of yet[,] our militia has only made minor dents to[N]
the capital;[.4] small infiltrations for supplies[,][N]
swift skirmishes[,]and an even faster retreat.[AN]

[MR]
You want me with absolute power over your army.[.6][N]
Why do you trust me?[.6] You don't know anything[N]
about me or what I'm capable of.[AN]

[ML]
I know what you're capable of[,] Ser.[.6][N]
And we can be[Beat] creative with your past[,][N]
even if it seems like lunacy.[AN]
Beseech me:[.4] a golden-eyed demon on the battlefield[,][N]
once thrown away by the empire[Beat] now leads the battle[N]
to liberate it.[AN]
We may have made small cracks yet[,] but they are[N]
starting to show.[.6] The entire country will know[N]
your name.[AN]

[MR]
I'm confident in my battlefield skills[,][N]
but I only know the very basics of statecraft[N]
and tactics.[AN]

Here[,]with our numbers[,] what do you propose[N]
as our next course of action?[AN]

[MR]
If we're low on numbers[,] I'd look at potential recruitment.[.6][N]
Many Aeterians are imprisoned below places we wouldn't[n]
even know where to look.[AN]

[ML]
Right[Beat] They suffer in cells[,] unilluminated.[.6][N]
You will be the light that saves them[,] bringing[N]
with you a new dawn;[.4] a classic hero narrative.[AN]
Manpower is always a priority[,] Ser.[.6] If we[N]
attempted to overthrow the Aeterian empire with[N]
our current numbers,[AN][C]
it would be tantamount to surrendering our heads[N]
and digging our own graves.[AN]

[MR]
Then[Beat] I think I have an idea[,] even if[N]
it seems a little farfetched.[AN]

[ML]
Elaborate.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat]Perhaps we could turn to the other[N]
side of Ideon for assistance?[AN]

[ML][MoveLeft]

[FL][Raya]
You couldn't possibly mean[Beat] Could we really[N]
turn to the people of Wreyvine for help?[.6][N]
We'd be marked as hostiles on sight.[AN][C]
They'd kill us before we could speak a[N]
single word.[AN]

[MR]
Their forces are grasping for air.[.6] The Duke[N]
claimed Castle Wreyvine and took the King's life[,][N]
emerging as the Emperor of both realms.[AN]
We only need to subdue and combine forces[,][N]
much like the Order and the Resistance[,] right?[AN]

[FL]
Tsch[Beat] I suppose that's right[Beat][N]
And I'm sure they'll all have a score to[N]
settle with the empire,[AN]
seeing as they're losing yet another war.[AN][C]
The Wreyvians definitely aren't happy with[N]
the Emperor's relentless control on their[N]
lands[,] either.[AN]

[L]
The final call is yours[,] Ser Chiffon.[AN]

[MR]
[Mouth](Yes, this should be it... This is the easiest[N]
way to move forward. Wreyvine is in a state[N]
of disarray. They hate the empire.)[AN][Mouth][C]
We share a common enemy.[.6] It's not too unthinkable[N]
of a strategy; if we can win over the kingdom's[N]
trust and take up arms together, then...[AN][C]
We have to get to Wreyvine[,] I'm sure of it.[6N]
If we go through with this plan[,] how many days[N]
would it take us to--[AN]

[L]
I estimate four:[.4] two by water[,] two on foot.[.6][N]
The war has barred the borders that pass[N]
through the sea.[AN][C]
Our only choice after we reach the crown[N]
city's port is to travel by foot to the[N]
other side of the bridge.[AN]

[FL]
Heh[Beat] Did you already plan the whole[N]
escapade we're venturing towards?[6N] Did[N]
you lead us to this conclusion?[AN]

[L]
Little more than a few hours ago[,] yes.[6N]
We have little option otherwise[,] akin to[N]
the kingdom.[AN]

[FL]
Even so[,]this will be a gambit[,]for sure.[.6][N]
Once we reach the bridge[,] there's no[N]
turning back.[AN][C]

[ML][Raial][MR][Chiffon][3L]

[ML]
So[,] pup[,] is Chiffon your actual name?[AN]

[MR]
I[Beat] don't know my actual name.[6N]
Like I said[,] I truly have no memory[N]
of my childhood.[AN][C]
Lady Vida called me Chiffon after the[N]
silk of the dress she found me in.[AN]

[ML]
Trust defines the outcome of battle and forges[N]
the strength of armies.[.6] So how will I learn[N]
to trust one whose name I don't even know?[AN]

[MR]
We are more than our names alone[,] are[N]
we not?[.6] While I can understand your[N]
caution[,] Captain--[AN]

[ML]
Don't.[.6] I'm not your captain[,]not yet.[AN]

[MR]
Raial[Beat] Listen[,] were I in your shoes I'd[N]
feel the exact same way.[.6] And I'm not quite[N]
sure what the Reverend sees in me[,] either[Beat][AN][C]
But if it means getting a shot at Major[N]
Hayes' head and fixing Aeteria[,] I'm in.[AN]

[ML]
[Beat]Hayes[,]huh?[.6] The Viper?[.6] Aeteria's newest lapdog?[6N]
Got history with him[,] eh?[AN]

[MR]
We crossed blades on the battlefield[,][N]
and I next woke up in a prison cell.[AN]

[ML]
Hm.[.6] Do not let that cloud your vision.[6N]
If you want to ride with us[,] you will need[N]
to keep your eyes on the prize ahead.[AN]
We fight to purge the rot from Aeteria[Beat][N]
to right the wrongs of the Emperor and[N]
rebuild the empire.[AN]
It is his mismanagement[,] his neglect[Beat][N]
his obsession with Wreyvian conquest[Beat][N]
that has led to the empire falling into this[AN]
shadow of her former self.[AN]

[MR]
Yeah[,]I saw it with my own eyes.[6N]
Villages going hungry[,]bandits roaming[N]
unchecked[,] corrupt officials[Beat][AN]
This land is bursting at the seams.[6N]
Not to mention the biting cold of the north[N]
reaching the empire[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Listen[,] [OpenQuote]Chiffon"[Beat] You'll have to pardon[N]
me for being so cautious off the bat.[6N]
These are my people.[AN][C]
This group here[,] we've been through a lot together[Beat][N]
I just don't want to lose it all.[AN]

[MR]
Like I said[,] I understand.[.6] And I'd[N]
be happy to prove your doubts wrong.[AN]

[MR]
Hey there.[.6] So[,] I have to ask you[,] Jaye[Beat]
Do you work with the Noctum Order[,] or are[N]
you part of Raial's mercenary group?[AN]

[ML]
Me?[.6] I'm with the Noctum Order![AN]

[MR]
Really?[.6] I thought they were all outcasts[N]
from the Aeterian court[Beat] But you don't[N]
strike me quite as nobility.[AN]

[ML]
[Smile]Really?[.6] Haven't you seen the lightning I[N]
can sling?[.6] The way it lights up the room?[6N]
The way it leaps from body to body![AN][Smile]

[MR]
I suppose so[Beat] You've got a noble's talent[N]
when it comes to magic[,] yes.[6N]
But your[,] um[,] conduct[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Haha[,] I get that a lot.[.6] Look[,] I've always[N]
been one to be myself[,]no matter what.[6N]
I'd say 'not being noble' is a complement.[AN]
I'm just not the type to remold my manner of[n]
speech just to suck up to some bigwig.[.6] I[N]
talk and act how I want[,] all else be damned![AN]

[MR]
Heh.[.6] I won't lie[,] your honest spirit does[N]
ease my soul a little.[.6] I kind of hate[N]
feeling stuffed up like that[,] you know?[AN][C]
So I get the feeling[,] absolutely.[AN]

[ML]
Hey[Beat] I know your eyes are usually glowy and[N]
stuff[Beat] But looking at them now[,] they[N]
almost seem a little tired.[AN]

[MR]
Was it that obvious?[6N]
It's been a long day for us.[AN]

[ML]
I don't blame you.[.6] I know Graham really wants[N]
to see you as our leader[Beat] I don't know what[N]
he's got in mind for you[,] but know this:[AN][Smile]
you're one of us now[,] no matter what happens[N]
going forward.[.6] So I'll always have your back[,][N]
okay?[.6] Don't forget it[,] Chiff![AN]

[ML]
That's me.[AN]

[MR]
You seem like a capable fighter.[6N]
I mean this with no offense[,] but[Beat][N]
How'd you end up in that prison?[AN]

[ML]
Skirmish gone wrong.[.6] We launched[N]
an attack on a supply outpost.[6N]
Didn't realize General Opali was there.[AN]

[MR]
General Opali[,] huh?[.6] That's unlucky.[AN]

[ML]
That woman is a paradox.[6N]
Her soul is soft as silk[,] yet[N]
her axe arm is strong as steel.[AN]
She subdued us with little effort[Beat][N]
but refused to take our lives.[6n]
I cannot fathom her line of thinking.[AN]

[MR]
I see[Beat] I hear she was quite the brutal fighter[N]
back in the old war.[AN]

[ML]
You'd think someone like her would realize the[N]
hypocrisy of it all.[.6] Serving a regime of lies[N]
like Selwyn's,[AN]
under the pretense of [OpenQuote]mercy"?[AN][C]
It would be more of a mercy for us if[N]
she brought her axe upon his head.[AN]

[MR]
Hah! I suppose that would be an[N]
easy solution to our little problem.[6N]
I did have another question[,]though.[AN]

[ML]
Make it quick.[AN]

[MR]
You're with Raial's mercenaries[,]aren't you?[6N]
I know she has her doubts about me[Beat][N]
So how can I change that?[AN][C]
What do I need to do to win her over?[AN]

[ML]
Pfft.[.6] The truth is the fact that you need to[N]
ask at all tells me you have a long way[N]
to go.[AN]

[MR]
I--[.4]Agh[,] come on[,]you've got to give me more[N]
than that![.6] I really want to be of help.[AN]

[ML]
I'll say this much[,]then.[.6] As long as you make[N]

You're Frye[,] if I remember?[AN]

[ML]
That's me[,] yeah.[6N]
What's a big shot like you doing[N]
spending time on a grunt like me?[AN]

[MR]
Well[,]if I might end up leading the crew[,] I have[N]
to know my comrades[,] right?[.6] So I thought I'd[N]
poke around and see how people were doing.[AN][C]
Especially since you were locked[N]
up in the cells with me[,] too[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Eh[,]nothing out of the ordinary.[6N]
Honestly[,] prison life wasn't too bad.[6N]
I've been through way worse.[AN]

[MR]
Ah[Beat] I thought it was pretty rough in[N]
there[,] though[Beat] Huh[Beat] Anyways[,] I was curious[Beat][N]
Do you know Captain Raial well?[AN]

[ML]
Well enough.[.6] You aren't taking her[N]
reaction to you too badly[,] are you?[6N]
Been there.[AN]

[MR]
I won't deny it hurts.[.6] But I understand[N]
her feelings all the same.[.6] I want to[n]
know[Beat] what can I do to win over her trust?[AN]

[ML]
Heh.[.6] Well[,] first and foremost[,]you don't [OpenQuote]win" it.[N]
You EARN it[,]by proving to her that[N]
you care about what you're fighting for.[AN]
That you're willing to go out of your way to[N]
fight with us for what's right.[6N]
[Beat]But you know what's wild?[AN]
Prickly and temper as she is[,]Captain's the[N]
most damn loyal person I know.[AN]

[MR]
Oh[,]really?[.6] I had a hunch like that[,] but[Beat][N]
hearing that makes a lot of sense.[AN]

[ML]
She's like a mother bear.[6N]
She'll fight for you[,] cry for you[Beat][N]
She'll make you feel right at home[AN]
when it feels like your hearth is empty.[AN]
Hell[,]I bet she would've stormed that[N]
prison for Cortado and me on her own[,][N]
army or no army.[AN]

[MR]
I see[Beat][AN]

[ML]
But if you abuse her loyalty or spin it[N]
into a weapon aimed at her heart[Beat][N]
She will utterly tear you to shreds.[AN]

[MR]
Haha[Beat] Looks like I don't have to[N]
worry about it then.[.6] I've no intention[N]
of betraying the trust she puts in me.[AN][C]
Still[,] I guess I have a real big job[N]
ahead of me[,] don't I?[AN]

[ML]
Yeah.[.6] But don't worry.[.6] As long[N]
as your own heart is intact[,] I'm sure[N]
you'll be just fine[,] Ser.[AN]

Should I ask[,] or[Beat]?[AN]

Well[,] you asked by saying that[,] to[N]
