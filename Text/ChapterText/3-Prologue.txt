[Pause]Been a while[,] hasn't it?[A][C][.6]
Since we've all been together like this.[6N]
It really brings me back to the[N]
start of the war.[AN]
[Pause]But you know how it is.[6N]
Cruel Fate truly does tie us all[N]
together[,] doesn't she?[AN]
It'll just be us this time[,][N]
just like old times.[.6] Only now[,][N]
there's no 7th Platoon[,] heh.[AN]
There's another mission coming up.[.6][N]
After everything that's happened[,] we'll[N]
need to make sure we can pull through.[AN][C][.4]
No matter the cost.[AN]

[FL][Hildr][L][Breve][R][Ulrich]

[L]
Welp.[.6] Here we are.[.6] I think I[N]
missed a memo somewhere.[.6] We're just[Beat][N]
gathering food and supplies?[AN]

[R]
Of course[Beat] not.[.6] Ready yourselves for battle.[6N]
Lord Gorlois uncovered an Aeterian stronghold[N]
off the ashen coast.[AN]
Been told we've spotted the last of the Imperial[N]
tents up ahead.[.6] Just beyond the cliff ridge.[6N]
It's nothing we can't handle.[AN]
Imperial stragglers[,] likely deserters or holdouts[,][N]
have holed up up there.[.6] We're to strike their[N]
supply caches before they can dig deeper.[AN]

[FL]
Lord Gorlois' routing is incredible[,] huh?[6N]
It's like he has eyes everywhere[Beat][AN]

[R]
And Consul Aoife is en route to the central[N]
castles where the palace used to be.[6N]
This is our only chance.[AN]

[L]
Bastards.[.6] They think they own this land?[AN]

[FL]
Can't blame them[,] really[Beat] Have you seen[N]
the dire state of the kingdom as of late?[AN]

[FR][Ansgar]
Seen?[.6] You mean lived through it[,] eh.[AN]

[R]
Enough.[.6] The empire will pay in blood.[6N]
We will burn and take any last scrap[N]
they took onto our lands.[AN]
This will be our first big mission in a[N]
while.[.6] The Consul's absence is something we[N]
must exploit while we can.[AN]

[FR]
So be it[,] eh?[.6] No chance for us to[N]
get rusty over the last few months.[.6] Just[N]
gotta make it a scarce more.[AN]

[FL]
Ansgar[Beat] Sigh[Beat][AN]

## Part3PrologueDisclaimer
Ulrich's death will result[N]
in a Game Over.[AN]
Additionally, generic units will[N]
leave the party after this chapter.[A]

You know what to do by now.[6N]
Seems like we're hunting vermin.[6N]
Don't let any of them escape![AN]

[ML][Breve]
Always Wreyvian[,] now and forever.[6N]
Fire in my heart[,] iron in my blood![AN][CF]

Alright[Beat] Let's do this![AN][CF]

[ML][Ansgar]
[Pause]Here we go.[AN]

## Part3PrologueATurn1

[3L]
[FR][Kelik]
You Kingdom dogs again[Beat]! Still barking I see![6N]
Even with a slain king[,] his royal army dares[N]
to dare to crawl from the ashes?[AN]

A lot's happened[,] you know?[6N]
I'd love to continue chatting[,] but we have[N]
to wipe out a group of pests on our land.[AN]

With such a[Beat] dwindling army?[.6][N]
Your bravery is naught but idiocy here.[6N]
I'll turn this grey red in the Emperor's memory.[AN]

[FR][Ulrich]
Heh.[.6] You'll try.[6N] Just make sure someone's left[N]
to tell your new Emperor how you died:[4N]
unknown in the ashen coasts.[AN]

[X]

## Part3PrologueAEnding1
[3L]
[MR][Ulrich]
It's done.[6N] The tents burn,[.4] the crates are dust[,][N]
and not a single Imperial soul remains.[AN]

[FL][Hildr]
Haha![.6] They won't be eating off our land[N]
anytime soon.[.6] We got 'em![AN]

[FR][Breve]
Look at that smoke rise[Beat] It's almost like[N]
a beacon or something.[.6] Or a warning[Beat][AN]

[FL][Ansgar]
Looks like we still got it[,] eh?[.6] But[Beat][N]
Sir Ulrich[,] ain't this bad?[.6] We can't 'ave[N]
'em rush over 'ere to see smoke and ash![AN]

[MR][Ulrich]
Then let them come.[.6] We'll be waiting.[6N]
Everything we broke apart is all for[N]
their eyes to see.[AN]
Fall back to the rendezvous point.[6N]
It's time to regroup with the rest of the army.[6N]
We'll need everyone for what comes next.[AN]

[ML][Raial][MR][Graham]
[MR]
[Pause]Without her[,] we lose momentum.[AN]

[ML]
Momentum's what you're thinking about[,] huh?[6N]
Not how we just lost our leader[Beat][AN]

[MR]
The mercenary girl with radiant magic who[N]
stood up to the Empire that she was fated[N]
to rule[Beat] The legend must survive.[AN]

[ML]
Tsch.[.6] She was never just some symbol[N]
for you to utilize.[.6] We need to find[N]
her--[.4]and fast.[AN]

[MR]
I thought we went over this already[,] Raial.[6N]
We survive now[,] and an opportune for her[N]
return will present itself.[AN]

[ML]
Any ideas for how we'll do that first part[,][N]3
Malcolm?[.6] In the meantime[,] all we can do is[N]
wait for the noble's response.[AN]

[MR]
Yes[,] I am sure he will welcome your army[N]
with open arms.[AN]

[FFL][Ilse]
Captain Raial![AN][CSS]

[ML][MoveLeft]
[FFL][MoveFarLeft]
Lord Reinier wants nothing to do with our[N]
forces[,] even after passing the letter.[6N]
He thinks us almost the Imperial army[,] I see.[AN][CF]

[L]
Damn it![AN]

[MR]
What an unwise decision.[AN]

[L]
We're quickly running out of options[Beat][N]
I know.[.6] We send off a few scouts and[N]
uncover the royal army's location.[AN][MML]
After that[,] we'll have them receive a message[N]
to form an alliance.[.6] They're desperate:[.4][N]
they can't say no here.[AN]

[MR]
Is that not what the first attempt was?[6N]
To repeat an option with a known result[N]
is the definition of foolishness.[AN]
You think the kingdom will simply join us?[6N]
Without the golden-eyed demon as our[N]
figurehead[,] asking nicely will not work here.[AN]

[ML]
Hell[,] just say it.[.6] What do you propose we do?[6N]
Because you've obviously been trying to[N]
lead us into asking about your plan.[AN]

[MR]
The Wreyvian army will not join us without[N]
a catalyst.[.6] They have little reason to trust[N]
us[,] Raial.[.6] We must give them one.[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]What are you saying?[6N]
Quit your games![AN]

[MR]
We take a noble of the Kingdom hostage.[6N]
That aforementioned Reinier sounds like a[N]
good start[,] wouldn't you agree?[AN]
We offer him in exchange for a formal[N]
meeting with the Wreyvians.[6N]
From there[,] diplomacy can resume.[AN]

[ML]
You want to blackmail them into a peace talk?[6N]
This is insanity[,] Graham.[AN]

[MR]
It is the only way[,] Raial.[.6][N]
There stands no chance of them parleying[N]
with us otherwise.[AN]

[ML]
Kidnapping one of their own isn't[N]
going to have them trust us.[6N]
They'll hate us.[AN]

[MR]
Trust?[.6] They need us and do not know it.[.6][N]
Their forces crumble apart.[.6] Their king is dead.[6N]
Their spirits are fractured.[AN]
We do not need to break the kingdom;[6N]
it has been broken for us.[.6] All we have[N]
to do is show them our worth,[AN]
and proceed to direct the pieces.[AN]

[ML]
You talk like you're playing with a puzzle.[.6][N]
This hostage scheme isn't some grand[N]
strategy[,] Graham.[.6] It's desperation[Beat][AN]

[MR]
We find ourselves in a position similar to[N]
the royal army.[.6] We are on borrowed time.[AN]

[ML]
Graham[Beat] You always talked about a new[N]
Aeteria--[.4]one with mercy, with honor.[.6][N]
Was that just another lie you fed to her?[AN]
To all of us?[AN]

[MR]
Princess Sylmeria was our star[,] yes.[6N]
But a star alone cannot burn away a[N]
tyrant's shadow.[AN]
The people need to see more than hope now.[6N]
They need to see results.[AN]

[ML]
So you'll risk all-out war with the kingdom?![6N]
Throw a lit match on a powder keg just[N]
just so you can drag them to the table?![AN]

[MR]
Raial[Beat] I would rather a scorched road than[N]
no road at all.[AN]

[ML]
You think they'll stand behind you when you[N]
start using nobles as bargaining chips?[AN]

[MR]
They will when they see it works.[.6][N]
They will when we[,] a unified force[,][N]
finally push the empire back.[AN]

[ML]
Tell me[,] what happens if this Reinier dies in[N]
our custody?[.6] What happens when Wreyvine sends[N]
tons of knights to avenge them?[AN][C]
What happens when blood spills and there's[N]
no turning back?[AN]

[MR]
First of all:[.4] Wreyvine has no knights to spare[N]
for some revenge plot.[.6] Second:[.4] then[N]
we adapt.[.6] As we always have.[AN]

[FFR][LoadVerna]
[Pause]I see we are back to this stage of[N]
the Liberation Army.[AN][CSS]

[MR][MoveRight]
[FFR][MoveFarRight]
Reverend[,] the guards are sweeping the bridge[N]
to the south.[.6] If we move now[,] we can[N]
slip through the hills and get the noble.[AN]
Reinier lays guarded in that castle.[6N]
Should be an easy catch[,] that old oaf[Beat][N]
We'll move at your order.[AN]

[ML]
You've already--[.4]you're going to drag this lord[N]
out in chains[,] and expect that to spark[N]
an alliance?![AN]

[MR]
Not an alliance[,] Raial.[.6] A negotiation.[6N]
Once they hear our terms[,] they will[N]
have no choice but to listen.[AN]
And Lady Verna.[.6] We need them to see us.[6N]
Let them believe we aim for their treasury[,][N]
and cut through like a knife.[AN]
They will have no chance to intercept.[6N]
Raial[,] I beg you to place your faith[N]
in me.[.6] For this rebellion.[6N]

[ML]
We're really doing this[,] huh?[6N]
As terrible an idea as it is[Beat][N]
Urgh[,] damn you[,] Malcolm.[AN]

Now let us proceed onwards.[AN]

You have[Beat] golden eyes like mine.[AN]

[MR]
Do I[,] now?[.6] I think I have chains[N]
like mine[,] too.[AN]

[L]
Not anymore[,] of course.[.6] You are free[N]
to stand.[.6] To walk if you please.[AN]

[MR]
Huh[Beat]?[.6] Listen[,] kid.[.6] You're the[N]
apostle of the empire.[.6] Aren't you afraid[N]
I'm going to kill you?[AN]

[L]
Would you?[.6] With what weapons?[AN]

[MR]
Back then[,] I shot[Beat] rays of light[Beat][N]
I was uncontrollable.[.6] I rampaged and shot[N]
them all down.[AN]

[L]
I heard.[.6] But[,] princess[Beat] We are in a safe[N]
place now.[.6] Free of all vice and the weight[N]
of the cold world beyond.[AN]
The weight of the world[Beat] is immense.[6N]
You must have been unable to handle[N]
that pressure most crushing[,] sister.[AN]

[MR]
I want out.[.6] Why didn't you kill me while[N]
you had the chance?[AN]

Because[Beat] I do not wish for your death.[6N]

[3L]
[ML][Sylveria][MR][Chiffon]

[MR]
You play pretty well.[AN]

[ML]
I learned how to play piano before I[N]
even learned to speak[,] to be fair.[6N]
It is[Beat] calming.[AN]
My mother taught me.[.6] It must have been[N]
the one thing she insisted I learn.[6n]
Do you recognize this melody?[AN]

[MR]
Heard it in the streets[,] growing up.[6N]
Usually a lot more triumphant with the[N]
horns and stuff though.[AN]

[ML]
It was meant to be a hymn of harmony.[6N]
But what is written in blood cannot be[N]
sung in peace.[AN]
I used to despise this song.[.6] I only learned it[N]
because Mother said I must.[.6] Yet now[Beat][N]
I find myself back to this song[,] over and over.[AN]
I think I keep playing it because it is[N]
the only thing that has not left me yet.[6N]
Come[,] sit.[.6] Just one song.[AN]

[MR]
Uhm[,] sure.[.6] Why're you doing this?[AN]

[ML]
I simply wanted to speak to you[,] sister to sister.[6N]
Even if you don't remember being one.[6N]
What have I missed?[AN]

[MR]
Well[,] I certainly don't know about my past.[6N]
I was thrown out of the Imperial palace[N]
before I could speak.[AN]
I'm assuming my father was[Beat] of the kingdom.[6N]
Maybe they thought I was too dangerous.[6N]
Hahaha![AN]

[ML]
I was told you were dead[,] Sylmeria.[.6] That the[N]
second-born daughter of the Imperial bloodline[N]
had fallen ill[,] and died quietly.[AN][C]
But[Beat] I never believed it.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Then[Beat] How did you survive in the cold?[AN]

[MR]
A woman took me in[,] far from Vale.[.6] Old[,] tough as[N]
nails[,] and oh-so diligent.[.6] She caught me stealing[N]
from her and said,[AN]
"If you're taking my bread, then you'd better[N]
learn to make it[,] lass."[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]Have you?[AN]

[MR]
Huh?[AN]

[ML]
Have you noticed the chills in the air?[6N]
Even when the ground lies beneath stone[N]
and flame[,] it bites.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat]Yes.[.6] I see it all around me[,] Apostle.[6N]
I can feel almost a charge.[AN]

[ML]
The lands of Ideon begin to freeze[,] and[N]
I am afraid[Beat] all of this unending cold[Beat][N]
It is all my fault.[AN]

[MR]
Sylveria[Beat] What do you mean?[AN]

[ML]
When I lost you[Beat] When Wulfric told me of[N]
Mother's passing[Beat] When my brother took the[N]
crown and cast everything aside[Beat][AN]
I feel the world get colder with every hour.[6N]
Yet winter cannot--[.4]will not--[.4]end until[N]
my last breath hits the air.[AN]

[MR]
You're saying this eternal winter[,] this war[,][N]
all of it[Beat] It's because of you?[AN]

[ML]
I never meant to.[AN][C]
But as I grew stronger[,] so did the storm.[6N]
So did the spirits of the Constellation[Beat][N]
And now[,] I cannot release this hold.[AN]
The Silver Serpent's influence grips those of Imperial[N]
blood.[.6] Her power[Beat] She illuminates the moon's light.[.6][N]
The sun wanes[,] and Ideon falls to rising cold.[AN]
This winter will ring eternal.[.6] I cannot find[N]
the power to stop it myself.[AN]

[MR]
Then[Beat] Let me go.[.6] Let me fight.[6N]
Let me finish this.[.6] Let me return to[N]
the Liberation Army[,] Apostle.[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]So you want to leave me[Beat][N]
Just let me play one last song.[6N]
Then I will open the way myself.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]You'll just let me go?[AN]

[ML]
You came back.[.6] That is enough for my heart.[6N]
I will not chain someone I finally got to meet[,][N]
especially if they show no desire to stay.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[ML]
But[Beat] Before you leave.[.6] You acknowledge that[N]
the next time our paths cross[,] it will[N]
be as enemies.[AN]

[MR]
[Mouth]........[Mouth][AN]

[ML]
Please.[.6] You must.[AN]

[MR]
I will[,] Apostle Sylveria.[.6] When I face you[N]
the battlefield[,] I will lead the Liberation Army[N]
and end your reign.[AN]

[ML]
Of course.[.6] Then allow me to give you these.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]A cloak and crown?[AN]

[ML]
These were Mother's.[.6] She wore it when she[N]
spoke to the people.[.6] I think it will[N]
suit you best.[AN]
You will need to guide the people.[6N]
Usher their voices and bring a shining[N]
light upon these moonlit lands.[AN]

[MR]
Sylveria[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Books.[.6] Piano.[.6] A voice like mine.[6N]
Even for such a brief moment[,] I felt like a[N]
world was lifted off of my shoulders.[AN]
I am truly happy to have met you.[6N]
You still have a role to play[,] Chiffon.[6N]
As I am not finished with mine.[AN][CloseEyes]
Farewell[,] my sister.[.6] I hoped only that we[N]
could have talked longer[,] but you must[N]
fulfill your duties as leader[Beat]![AN]
