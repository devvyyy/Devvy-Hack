Welp.[.6] Here we are.[.6] I think I[N]
missed a memo somewhere.[.6] We're just[Beat][N]
gathering food and supplies?[AN]

[R]
Of course[Beat] not.[.6] Ready yourselves for[N]
battle.[.6] Lord Gorlois uncovered an Aeterian[N]
stronghold off the ashen coast.[AN]
Been told we've spotted an Imperial[N]
camp up ahead.[.6] Just beyond the cliff ridge.[6N]
It's nothing we can't handle.[AN]
Imperial stragglers[,] likely deserters or[N]
holdouts[,] have holed up there and[N]
taken refuge.[AN]
We're to strike their supply caches[N]
before they can dig deeper into[N]
the kingdom.[AN]

[FL]
Lord Gorlois' routing is incredible[,] huh?[6N]
It's like he has eyes everywhere[Beat][AN]

[L]
When I first saw him all those months ago[,][N]

up the flag in His Majesty's place.[AN]

what's left of Wreyvine hasn't crumbled.[6N]
I must say[,] I've found new respect for him.[AN]

[FL][MoveFL]
You better![.6] It's all thanks to Lord Gorlois's[N]
abilities that we've been able to avoid[N]
Imperial detection for so long.[AN]

And the spies say Consul Aoife has turned[N]
her sights back towards the central border.[6N]
Her eyes gaze elsewhere.[.6] This is our chance.[AN]

[R]
Enough.[.6] The empire will pay in blood.[6N]
We will burn and take any last scrap[N]
they took onto our lands.[AN]
This will be our first big mission in a[N]

[MR]
There you are[,] Commander.[6N]
And not a moment too soon.[6N]
Urgent news.[AN]

[L]
Eisner?[.6] What's the matter?[6N]
Did something happen on the[N]
Second Division's end?[AN]

[MR]
Not quite.[.6] But the Third Division was[N]
captured[Beat] Their maneuver on Fort[N]
Storus was a complete bust.[AN]
[CSS]
[FL][Breve][MoveFL]
The Third Division?![.6] But Lord Reinier[N]
and General Klavdia were leading them![6N]
What manner of force could fell them?[AN]

[MR]
I saw it all from afar.[.6] Lord Reinier[N]
had the upper hand until Eustace of[N]
the Magi Trinity arrived on the fray.[AN]
He caught them off guard[,] and his[N]
magic prowess subdued them easily.[AN]
Lord Reinier surrendered to them,[4N]
and the survivors were taken captive[N]
inside the fort.[AN]
[CSS]

[FL][Ansgar][MoveFL]
Eustace[,] eh?[.6] Shoulda known that[N]
hoser had been too quiet lately.[AN][C]
But I can't imagine that Klavdia[N]
goin' down without a fight,[4N]
scary magic or not.[AN]

[MR]
She didn't.[.6] But Eustace sapped her[N]
strength with a staff[,] and it didn't[N]
take much for them to capture her.[AN]

[L]
Lord Reinier made the right choice.[6N]
Eustace's casting style is especially[N]
effective at tearing through wings.[AN]
And Reinier's group had most of our[N]
fliers[,] too.[.6] Had a fight broken out,[4N]
casualties would've been inevitable.[AN]

[MR]
Aye[,] I'm not disagreeing.[.6] He probably[N]
surrendered in hopes of sparing the[N]
lives of the rest of the division.[AN]
Hell[,] it's a miracle I managed to slip[N]
out unscathed myself.[AN]

[L]
If they've taken some of ours captive,[4N]
we need to regroup and figure out how[N]
to get them back as soon as we can.[AN]
They may have taken Reinier alive[,] but[N]
who knows how long that'll be the[N]
case for.[AN]

[MR]
Glad we're on the same page.[6N]
Lord Gorlois wants us all to regroup.[6N]
No time to waste[,] now.[.6] Let's go.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]Without her[,] we lose momentum.[AN]

[ML]
Momentum's what you're thinking about[,] huh?[6N]
Our leader's gone[,] and this is where[N]
your mind spaces?[AN]

[MR]
With the power awakened within her[,][N]
she will survive all they hurl at her.[6N]
But it is her image that we must retain.[AN]
The mercenary girl with radiant magic who[N]
stood up to the Empire that she was fated[N]
to rule[Beat] The legend must survive.[AN]

[ML]
Tsch.[.6] It disgusts me hearing you speak[N]
speak of her like that.[.6] Like a tool.[6N]
But you're not the one in command.[AN][C]
We're finding her[,] with or without you.[AN]

[MR]
I thought we went over this already[,] Raial.[6N]
We survive now[,] and an opportune for her[N]
return will present itself.[AN]

[ML]
I want to do far more than [OQ]survive".[6N]
And for that[,] I have an idea in mind.[AN]

[MR]
As do I.[.6] But do tell.[AN]

[ML]
There's no way Aeteria managed to[N]
snuff out every ounce of Wreyvian[N]
pride in these lands[,] right?[AN]
There's all kinds of rumors abound of[N]
an underground resistance[,] made up[N]
of remnants of the royal army[Beat][AN]
The Trinity have been trying to track[N]
them down for months[,] to no avail.[AN]
If we can wrangle together enough[N]
support from the other side to push back[N]
into Aeteria[,] towards Chiffon[Beat][AN]

[MR]
You think the kingdom will simply join us?[6N]
Without the golden-eyed demon as our[N]
figurehead[,] asking nicely will not work here.[AN][C]
If we are to join hands[,] we must give them[N]
reason to do so that they cannot refuse.[AN]

[ML]
We have one.[.6] A mutual cause.[AN]

[MR]
But will that truly be enough to--[AN]

[FFL][Ilse]
Captain Raial![AN][CSS]

[ML][MoveLeft]
[FFL][MoveFarLeft]

[L]
So the scouting party has returned?[6N]
What's ahead on the road?[AN]

[FL]
There's a border fortress up ahead,[4N]
all prettied up with Imperial soldiers.[AN]
[CSS]
[MR][MoveFarRight]

[R][Verna]
That's not all.[.6] I spotted Wreyvian[N]
knights in the fortress[,] too.[6N]
The empire has prisoners.[AN]

[FR]
What a serendipitous boon for us.[AN]

[FL]
If I overheard right from the patrol,[4N]
they're sentenced to the gallows soon.[AN]

[R]
Didn't need to hear it from the patrol.[6N]
I think the yawping from that loud[N]
buffoon was enough to get the gist.[AN]

[L]
I don't like the look in your eyes[,] Malcolm.[6N]
[Beat]Hey[,] you still with us?[.6] You're[N]

[CSS]

[FR][MoveRight]
We cannot let this chance slip by[,] Raial.[.6N]
This is the turn of fate we need.[AN][C]
With hostages in our hands[,] the kingdom's[N]
remnants would have the perfect incentive[N]
to step out of the shadows and seek us out.[AN]

[L]
[OQ]Hostages"?[.6] You mean to capture the[N]
prisoners and use them as leverage?[6N]
Do you WANT to make them hate us?[AN]

[R]
Do you truly think that men of Wreyvine[N]
would willingly choose to join hands with[N]
those beneath the Aeterian flag?[AN]
The same Aeteria whose emperor[N]
stomped them underfoot[,] and reduced[N]
their proud kingdom into this wreck?[AN]

[L]
But we are different from the emperor.[6N]
If they have little reason to trust us,[4N]
then we must prove that to them.[AN]

[FL]
Makes sense[Beat][N]
So what's our move[,] Captain?[AN]

[L]
We provide them with an act of goodwill,[4N]
by rescuing and returning their[N]
lost men.[AN]
Once they see how we've treated them[N]
while they were among our ranks[Beat][N]
that will open the way to an alliance.[AN]

[FR][Verna]
Reverend,[....] the guards are sweeping the bridge[N]
to the south.[......] If we move now,[....] we can[N]
slip through the hills and get inside.[AN][C]
Whatever we do[,] we must do it fast.[6N]
The executions will likely begin soon.[AN]

[R]
[Beat]Very well.[.6] We do it your way[,] Raial.[AN]

[L]
I[Beat] huh?[.6] You're actually on my side?[AN]

[R]
Time is of the essence.[.6] We can[N]
decide what to do with the Wreyvians[N]
after the fortress is secured.[AN]
But for this to work[,] we need to lock their[N]
guards' sights on us.[.6] Let them believe we[N]
are sellswords reaching for their treasury.[AN]
Then[,] we cut through like a knife.[6N]
They will have no chance to intercept.[6N]
Raial[,] I trust you at the vanguard.[AN]

[L]
That so?[.6] That's the most flattering thing[N]
you've ever said to me[,] Malcolm.[AN][C]
Let's go[,] everyone![.6] We got some[N]
royal mutts to save![AN]

do it fast.[AN]

[R]
Lady Verna?[.6] You must have seen the face[N]

[FR]
No idea.[.6] But he must be highly ranked[,][N]
judging from the over-polish in his armor.[AN]

[L]
Hahahaha![.6] Even Malcolm can't hide the stupid[N]
grin on his face![.6] What's going on in[N]

[R]
The Wreyvian army will not join us without[N]
a catalyst.[.6] They have little reason to trust[N]
us[,] Raial.[.6] We must give them one.[AN]

[L]
If we rescue the knights in the fortress[,][N]
that'd surely be enough for them.[AN]

[R]
We must take a knight of the empire hostage[N]
as well.[.6] Wouldn't you agree that this[N]
is the best road forward?[AN]
We offer him in exchange for a formal[N]
meeting with the royal army.[6N]
From there[,] diplomacy can resume.[AN]

That's low[Beat] But if it works[,] it works.[6n]
We got a lot of bargaining chips on[N]

Heh.[.6] To think such a renowned merc is[N]
stooping to something so low.[AN]

I heard of a rebellion right down the river.[6N]

You think this Imperial idiot will be enough[N]

[L]
Trust?[.6] They need us and do not know it.[.6][N]
Their forces crumble apart.[.6] Their king is dead.[6N]
Their spirits are fractured.[AN]
We do not need to break the kingdom;[6N]
it has been broken for us.[.6] All we have[N]
to do is show them our worth,[AN]
and proceed to direct the pieces.[AN]

[MR]
You talk like you're playing with a puzzle.[.6][N]
Very well[,] then.[.6] Just what're you scheming?[AN]

[L]
We find ourselves in a position similar to[N]
the royal army.[.6] We are on borrowed time.[6N]
Resorting to extreme measures is natural.[AN]
Princess Sylmeria was our star[,] yes.[6N]
But a star alone cannot burn away a[N]
tyrant's shadow.[AN][C]
The people need to see more than hope now.[6N]
They need to see results.[AN]

[MR]
Don't you think that[Beat] this could risk[N]
all-out war with the kingdom?[6N]
Then we'd be outta cards.[AN]

Risks are mandatory.[.6] This sudden anxiety[N]
is quite unlike you[,] Raial.[AN]

You heard the guy.[.6] Chiffon's alone in[N]

Is Wreyvine our only choice?[AN]

[L]
There is no choice.[.6] I believe in[N]
Her Highness.[.6] She will break free of her[N]
shackles and return to us.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]Graham.[.6] Are you still on about that[N]
damned prophecy?[.6] You wanna throw a lit[N]

Everything is spinning a wheel with you.[6N]
A bullshit prophecy to free our leader.[6N]
These kingdom soldiers[Beat] And[Beat][AN]
That stupid[,] idiotic hostage[Beat][N]
Just so you can drag them to the table.[AN]

[L]
Raial.[.6] I would rather a scorched road than[N]
no road at all.[.6] This is what we settled on[N]
when we appointed her as leader.[AN]

[MR][MoveRight]
You think they'll still stand behind you[N]
when you start using all these nobles as[N]
bargaining chips?[AN]

[L]
They will when they see it works.[.6][N]
They will when we[,] a unified force[,][N]
finally push the empire back.[AN]

[R]
I trust your judgment[,] Malcolm[Beat][N]
But if you ever lose sight of the[N]
rebellion's goals[,] I'll see through it.[AN]

Acceptable.[.6] I do value your acuity[,] Raial.[.6][N]

[FL]
We are Aeteria's Liberation Army[,] those[N]
who will bring down Emperor Selwyn and his[N]
reign upon Ideon.[AN]

[L]
I'm Raial of Vintrus[,] a captain of a mercenary[N]
band.[.6] The pompous man's Graham of[N]
the Noctum Order.[AN]

[R]
[Pause]What a fascinating division.[AN]

[FR]
And what the hell're ye all doin'[N]
in the kingdom?[AN]

[R]
We were driven here by Imperial soldiers.[6N]
There was a battle at the bridge[,] and[N]
a Consul took our leader[Beat][AN]

[R]
I will speak plain:[.4] what does your[N]
[OpenQuote]Liberation Army" exactly intend[N]
to do with the kingdom guard?[AN][CSS]

[FL][MoveLeft]
Captain Brudet.[AN]
We intend to unite the continent under[N]
one banner[,] fighting side-by-side[N]
with the kingdom.[AN]

[FL]
The fight's already bigger than any one army.[6N]
If we want the throne out of Selwyn's grip[,][N]
we have to do this.[AN]

[R]
You say that like it's noble.[.6][N]
What do you know of our war[,] Raial[N]
of Vintrus?[AN]

[FL]
More than you think.[.6] We bled from the[N]
same Imperial soldiers and were cut with[N]
the same blades.[AN]

[FR]
Sure[,] that's valiant an' all.[.6] But[N]
how do we know ye want cut our backs?[6N]
One battle's one battle[,] y'know?[AN]

[R]
[Pause]Forgive me for prying.[.6][N]
The Noctum Order is a directive dedicated[N]
to[Beat] disruption[,] am I correct?[AN]
They operate outside the Imperial court[N]
and outside any noble's claim to legitimacy.[6N]
Just who are you[,] Graham?[AN]

[L]
A traitor[,] if you asked the court.[6N]
A rat[,] if you asked the Consuls.[6N]
And a threat[,] if you asked the Emperor.[AN]
We of the Order were cast out personally[N]
by the Emperor for dissent.[6N]
The court branded us all as radicals.[AN]
I will remind you that we have little[N]
reason to fight against the same kingdom[N]
that was crushed by the same Emperor.[AN]

[FL]
We're not asking for loyalty here.[6N]
You see how Wreyvine begins to crack.[6N][MoveFL]
We're offering an alliance![AN]

[R]
We are aware of the kingdom's wounds.[6N]
That is not what I question.[6N]
Precisely what does this alliance entail?[AN]

[R]
We strike the Emperor and the Apostle[N]
before their hold becomes unbreakable.[6N]
We dismantle their strongholds one by one.[AN]
We will rally all who have been disillusioned[N]
and restore the throne to the true heir[N]
of Aeteria.[AN]

[FR]
Strike the bastard[Beat] Hah![6N]
You don't lack for guts.[.6] I'll give ya that.[AN]

[R]
You've still not answered the real question.[6N]
How do we know you're not simply[N]
another faction chasing a throne?[AN]

[L]
We do not chase thrones[,] Captain Brudet.[6N]
We burn the chains that bind them and[N]
shackle the people.[AN]
Only through faith and blood can the[N]
lands of Ideon heal.[.6] And the step[N]
begins with our armies combined.[AN]

[FR]
Twist my arm[,] will ya?[.6] Now you're talkin'[N]
like one o' those preachers.[.6] An' I don't[N]
much like preachers.[AN][CSS]

[FL][MoveLeft]
Then listen to me instead[,] Captain.[6N]
I'm a blade-for-hire[,] and just about as[N]
far from Graham as one possible can be.[AN]
I've got no holy tongue or anything.[6N]
I just know what losing looks like[,][N]
and I know who put us there.[AN]
A shared enemy puts us as equals.[6N]
I know the kingdom will make for fine allies--[.4][N]
even the noisy guy blundering hot air.[AN]

[FR][MoveFR]
Hot air?[.6] You wanna fight[,] huh?![AN][C]
I got more than enough strength left for[N]
you and that scraggly preachin' string[N]
bean twiddling his face![AN]

[R]
Cease this.[.6] She's correct[,] even if her[N]
tone is harsh.[.6] We must be honest[N]
with ourselves here.[AN]
Neither the kingdom or your Liberation[N]
Army can continue to stand alone[,] lest[N]
we get wiped by the empire.[AN]
But do you believe you can truly slay[N]
them both?[.6] The Emperor and the Apostle?[6N]
If the Emperor falls[,] who rises in his place?[AN]

[L]
Her name is Princess Sylmeria.[.6] She led our[N]
rebellion and was taken by the Consul.[6N]
She's the lost heir to Aeteria.[AN]
I don't know where exactly she is[,][N]
but she may be the last thread that[N]
ties any chance we have of peace.[AN]

[R]
You speak strategy[,] but what of the[N]
aftermath?[.6] Do you intend to place her[N]
on the throne?[AN][C]
After everything that will occur?[AN]

[FL]
I believe in Her Highness.[6N]
She walks the right path for[N]
Aeteria's bright future.[AN]

[R]
If what you say is[Beat] true[,][N]
and if the Imperial princess truly lives--[4N]
then we must move.[AN]

[L]
Do you know where the rest of the[N]
royal army is?[.6] You all have a big[N]
and fancy hideout[,] right?[AN]

[R]
After the Emperor's conquest[,] we were[N]
forced to scatter.[.6] We split off because[N]
of Captain Stroganoff's[Beat] little stunt.[AN]

[FR]
That really was my fault[,] huh?[6N]
Shit.[AN]

[R]
This[Beat] humility is a pleasant surprise.[6N]
I have been saying this the entire time.[AN]

[FR]
And damn your fancy speeches.[AN]
I still don't trust the priest[,] but[N]
if the Emperor falls by your hand,[AN]
I might just raise a toast![AN]

[FL]
You will find that this arrangement[N]
will prove invaluable in time.[AN]

[R]
This cause is no longer ours alone.[6N]
We will walk the long road with you[N]
and regroup with the royal army.[AN]
But make no mistake[,] rebels.[6N]
If you steer us wrong[,] we will[N]
strike you down ourselves.[AN]

[L]
Fair.[.6] I'd expect nothing less.[6N]
How about it?[.6] An alliance with the[N]
kingdom[,] hahahaha![AN]

Why are you holding back?[.6] Fight me![6N]
You say I'm not ready[,] then push me![AN]

[ML]
Enough[,] sister[Beat] You unravel once again.[.6][N]
Breathe.[.6] This is not how one[N]
wields power.[AN]

[MR][MoveMR]
I can't stop it[Beat] I can't control it![6N]
I try to be their hope,[.4] their weapon,[.4][N]
their savior[Beat][AN][C]
But this light![.6] It always eats me alive![6N]
What do you know about this?![AN]

[ML]
You are my sister[,] Sylmeria.[.6] I have[N]
already lived your storm once before.[6N]
I freed the light.[AN]

[MR][MoveMR]
[Pause]Huh?[AN]

[ML]
When I was thirteen[,] I nearly killed half of[N]
the palace staff.[.6] My first invocation[N]
went wild.[.6] I lost control.[AN]
I remember each of their faces[Beat][N]
Mother's frown[Beat] Sel's amazement[Beat][N]
I couldn't stop crying then.[AN]
It got so bad[,] Consul Aoife made me a[N]
mug of chocolate and told me to [OQ]please[N]
not light up the dining hall."[AN]
She compared it to the lanterns in[N]
the sky at Mother's auguration[Beat][N]
except far more[Beat] explosive.[AN]
Maynard apparently ran to console me[,][N]
but I hid in the palace as far as I[N]
possibly could.[AN][C]
[Pause]The only person who came to find me[N]
was my piano instructor.[AN]

[MR]
Okay[Beat] Wait[,] what's your point?[AN]

[ML]
He found me tucked beneath the stairs.[N]
Do you know what he said?[AN]

[MR]
He came to console you[,] right?[6N]
So probably stuff like[,] [OQ]Oh[,] it's okay[,] let's[N]
get back to piano!" or something.[AN]

[ML]
He said,[.4] [OQ]Now little lady,[.4] I am paid[N]
handsomely to teach you music,[.6] not hunt[N]
you down in carpets."[AN]

[MR]
Heh[Beat] I don't suppose that helped your[N]
situation at all.[AN]

[ML]
Not at first.[.6] But he[Beat] he did not flinch.[6N]
He simply smoothed out his coat and sat[N]
beside me.[AN]
He told me of a story about a babbling friend[N]
of his who practiced light[,] much like us[,][N]
who's emotions oft got the better of him.[AN]

[MR]
He had a babbling friend?[.6] Sister[,] your[N]
piano teacher sounded like he was one[N]
wordy guy.[AN]

[ML]
I must admit[Beat] He loved the sound of his[N]
own voice.[.6] Regardless[,] he compared casting[N]
spells to[Beat] playing music[,] of all things.[AN]

[MR][MoveMR]
Hah![.6] This guy's a hoot.[.6] You think he[N]
did standup at taverns and stuff?[AN]

[ML]
[OQ]Little lady[,] if I could give ya a little[N]
outsider perspective[Beat] You ain't losin' control[,][N]
you're just playin' every note at once."[AN]
[OQ]So just try to play one[Beat] Then another.[.6][N]
Then a third[,] and you'll find the shape[N]
of your song."[AN]

[MR]
So[Beat] you want me to learn piano and[N]
listen to this guy's cheesy advice?[6N]
Is that it?[AN]

[ML]
No[,] no.[.6] Think of a note.[.6] One clean note.[.6][N]
A quiet one;[.4] not loud[,] just steady[,] and[,][N]
most importantly[,] strong.[AN]
Hold that feeling in your chest[Beat][N]
Feel your hand pulse with light[Beat] And let[N]
the arcane--[.4]the ether follow it.[AN]
The Serpent's light does not ask to be[N]
fired wildly[,] sister.[.6] It begs to be guided[,][N]
and channeled[,] and directed.[AN]

[MR]
Steady and strong[,] huh[Beat]?[6N][CloseEyes]

Are you[Beat] You're not lying to me[,] are you?[AN]

[ML]
Never would I do such a thing[,] sister.[6N]
You have my fullest sincerity.[AN]

[MR]
I guess[Beat] I'm still worried[,] though.[AN]
I mean[,] I went from leading an army to[N]
being the heir to the Empire[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Of course.[.6] But allow that fear to guide your[N]
restraint[,] not smother your will.[6N]
You are still a noble.[AN]

[MR]
Heh[,] am I[,] now?[.6] Anyways[,] thanks[,] Apostle.[6N]
You're a heck of a better fighter than I[N]
would've expected.[AN]
Er[,] not because I didn't think you were[N]
powerful or anything[,] it's just I've always[N]
envisioned you less of a combatant.[AN]

[ML]
I abhor violence[,] yes.[.6] If I could[,] I would[N]
spend my remaining days playing little[N]
songs in this quiet courtyard.[AN]

[MR]
You must be good at it.[.6] Piano[,] I mean.[AN]

[ML]
Not any more talented than anybody else[N]
who has spent so much time developing[N]
their skills.[AN][C]
This courtyard used to echo with sound[,][N]
after all.[AN]

[MR]
Really?[.6] It feels a little bit too chilly[N]
in here for music.[AN]

[ML]
It was not always the case[Beat] I[Beat][N]
It was just[Beat] small things that would[N]
play here.[AN]

[MR]
Like[Beat] what?[AN]

[ML]
Scales[,] warm-ups[,] scolding[Beat][N]
Sel was too nervous and proud to touch[N]
the keys.[AN]
And I played the wrong notes so confidently[N]
that no one dared correct me until[N]
Mother hired an instructor.[AN][C]
Ha[Beat] My conduct back then was hardly[N]
befitting an apostle of Aeteria[Beat][AN]

[MR]
You still play?[.6] I wanna hear it.[6N]
I've been so used to fighting I never[N]
really got a chance to relax.[AN]

[ML]
Of course[Beat] If I can absolve any of[N]
your pain now[,] I will.[.6] We both have[N]
many battles ahead of us.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]Yeah.[.6] And I don't intend on losing.[6N]
To you[,] to the Warden[,] to nobody.[AN]

[ML]
The Warden[Beat] Your paths are destined to cross[N]
once again.[.6] Will you be able to face[N]
such a foe?[AN]

[MR]
Huh?[.6] Of course I am.[.6] I'm ready.[6N]
[Pause]What do you know about that guy?[AN]

How unfortunate.[.6] I believe that were it[N]

I'm sworn to kill you.[.6] Why are you[N]

[ML]
Sworn?[.6] But you never chose this path[Beat][N]
It was the cruel whims of Fate who[N]
forced this life on you.[AN]

I guess so.[.6] But what can we really[N]
do about it[,] right?[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]Do you believe in Fate[,] sister?[6N]
The sort that threads lives together through[N]
small ripples like the beat of wings.[AN]

[MR]
The butterfly thing?[.6] Yeah[,] I've heard a[N]
little about it.[.6] Something about how one[N]
small moment shifts the world.[AN][C]
I guess I think about it sometimes.[AN]
Like how I stole from the wrong woman[,][N]
or how I picked the wrong fight and[N]
got thrown in a cell.[AN]

[ML]
Yes.[.6] A single note off course[,] a soldier[N]
surviving against all odds[Beat][N]
And everything after turns anew.[AN]
If you had never been taken from us[Beat][N]
Would this war still blaze like so?[.6][N]
Would I have become Apostle?[AN]

[MR]
You never got a say in any of it[,][N]
did you?[.6] You were kinda just born[N]
into this role.[AN][C]
I mean[,] hell[,] even your songs were[N]
written for you.[AN]

[ML]
I never chose to be Apostle[,] or to[N]
train as a vessel of faith.[.6] The[N]
Serpent chose us[,] sister.[AN]

[MR]
Then[Beat] Why did I lose control?[AN]

[ML]
It is our gift[,] sister.[.6] We share the[N]
Serpent's blood and her gift of magic[N]
brought by our gaze of gold.[AN]

[MR]
Sounds more like a curse[,] doesn't it?[AN]

[ML]
Perhaps[Beat] I[,] too[,] could not keep my mind[N]
from stirring.[.6] Unfettered[,] I unleashed the[N]
Norlis upon those of Wreyvine[Beat][AN]

[MR]
Those[Beat] things that blended in with[N]
the night?[.6] So that's your doing.[AN]

[ML]
[OQ]The Norlis:[.4] grief given form through[N]
ether[,] shaped by light.[.6] The memories[N]
of those we lost beneath the night."[AN]
That is why the kingdom fears us.[6N]
Our expressions--[.4]my invocations[,] and[N]
your rays of light.[AN]
When our hearts cannot find an escape[,][N]
the arcane seeps through and the[N]
Serpent takes over.[AN]

[MR]
So why bring me here?[.6] None of this[N]
makes any damn sense.[AN]

[ML]
I bear no ill will towards you.[.6][N]
But those untouched by the arcane cannot[N]
fathom beyond reason.[AN]
They fear you[,] dear sister.[6N]
There is no prophecy or twist of Fate;[.6][N]
I know things can change.[AN][MoveML]
You can be inaugurated as the lost heir![6N]
The people can see you for what I see:[.4][N]
the resolved princess who came back.[AN]

[MR]
Apostle[Beat] I'm sorry.[.6] I'm not[N]
the one you were yearning for.[6N]
I'm the leader of the Liberation Army.[AN]

[ML]
You are not their weapon for war[Beat][N]
You are my sister[,] Sylmeria[,] the next[N]
heir to the Aeterian Empire.[AN]

[MR]
Then let me ask you something.[6N]
Back on the bridge[Beat] before I was[N]
sent here to you[Beat][AN]
Something took ahold of me[,] and I[N]
started raining hell on my enemies.[6N]
I couldn't even see straight.[AN]
Even back then[Beat] I[Beat] I killed the one[N]
who protected me[Beat] with a single flash[N]
of light[Beat][AN]
Am I[Beat] destined to be some sort[N]
of[Beat] lightslinger?[.6] Will I start hurting[N]
more people than I protect?[AN]

[ML]
The Serpent's pulse echoes louder when your[N]
heart stammers.[.6] Fear,[.4] anger,[.4] even[N]
joy[Beat] unmoored emotion twist to light.[AN]

[MR]
Very poetic way to dodge the question[,] sis.[AN]

[ML]
No[,] but only if you hone the Serpent's light[N]
properly[,] with form.[.6] If you continue[N]
down this path[,] I fear[Beat][AN]

[MR]
Then tell me:[.4] how do I not mess this up?[AN]

[ML]

Well[,] I certainly don't know about my past.[6N]
I was thrown out of the Imperial palace[N]
