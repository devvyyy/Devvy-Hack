[Pause]Been a while[,] hasn't it?[A][C][.6]
Since we've all been together like this.[6N]
It really brings me back to the[N]
start of the war.[AN]
[Pause]But you know how it is.[6N]
Cruel Fate truly does tie us all[N]
together[,] doesn't she?[AN]
It'll just be us this time[,][N]
just like old times.[.6] Only now[,][N]
there's no 7th Platoon[,] heh.[AN]
There's another mission coming up.[.6][N]
After everything that's happened[,] we'll[N]
need to make sure we can pull through.[AN][C][.4]
No matter the cost.[AN]

[L]
Welp.[.6] Here we are.[.6] I think I[N]
missed a memo somewhere.[.6] We're just[Beat][N]
gathering food and supplies?[AN]

[R]
Of course[Beat] not.[.6] Ready yourselves for[N]
battle.[.6] Lord Gorlois uncovered an Aeterian[N]
stronghold off the ashen coast.[AN]
Been told we've spotted an Imperial
camp up ahead.[.6] Just beyond the cliff ridge.[6N]
It's nothing we can't handle.[AN]
Imperial stragglers[,] likely deserters or[N]
holdouts[,] have holed up there and[N]
taken refuge.[AN]
We're to strike their supply caches[N]
before they can dig deeper into[N]
the kingdom.[AN]

[FL]
Lord Gorlois' routing is incredible[,] huh?[6N]
It's like he has eyes everywhere[Beat][AN]

[R]
And Consul Aoife is en route to the central[N]
castles where the palace used to be.[6N]
This is our only chance.[AN]

[L]
Bastards.[.6] They think they own this land?[AN]

[FL]
Can't blame them[,] really[Beat] Have you seen[N]
the dire state of the kingdom as of late?[AN]

[FR][Ansgar]
Seen?[.6] You mean lived through it[,] eh.[AN]

[R]
Enough.[.6] The empire will pay in blood.[6N]
We will burn and take any last scrap[N]
they took onto our lands.[AN]
This will be our first big mission in a[N]
while.[.6] The Consul's absence is something we[N]
must exploit while we can.[AN]

[FR]
So be it[,] eh?[.6] No chance for us to[N]
get rusty over the last few months.[.6] Just[N]
gotta make it a scarce more.[AN]

You Kingdom dogs again[Beat]! Still barking I see![6N]
I thought after that other platoon[,][N]
none else was gonna come here.[AN][C]
Even with a slain king[,] his royal army dares[N]
to dare to crawl from the ashes?[AN]

A lot's happened[,] you know?[6N]
I'd love to continue chatting[,] but we have[N]
to wipe out a group of pests on our land.[AN]

With such a[Beat] dwindling army?[.6][N]
Your bravery is naught but idiocy here.[6N]
I'll turn this grey red in the Emperor's memory.[AN]

[FR][Ulrich]
Heh.[.6] You'll try.[6N] Just make sure someone's left[N]
to tell your new Emperor how you died:[4N]
unknown in the ashen coasts.[AN]

It's done.[6N] The tents burn,[.4] the crates are dust[,][N]

[FL][Hildr]
Haha![.6] They won't be eating off our land[N]
anytime soon.[.6] We got 'em![AN]

[FR][Breve]
Look at that smoke rise[Beat] It's almost like[N]
a beacon or something.[.6] Or a warning[Beat][AN]

[FL][Ansgar]
Looks like we still got it[,] eh?[.6] But[Beat][N]
Sir Ulrich[,] ain't this bad?[.6] We can't 'ave[N]
'em rush over 'ere to see smoke and ash![AN]

[MR][Ulrich]
Then let them come.[.6] We'll be waiting.[6N]
Everything we broke apart is all for[N]
the Emperor's eyes to see.[AN]

[FR]
Sir Ulrich.[.6] And what of their commander?[AN]

[MR]
We need any intel we can get.[6N]
Bring her here.[AN]

[MR][MoveLeft]
Hm[,] I recognize that handkerchief.[.6][N]
Care to indulge us?[6N]
Why were you here?[AN]

[MR]
What's there to explain[Beat]?[6N]
We were holdouts of the empire.[6N]
Dead men from the beginning.[AN]
By the time you got here[,] most[N]
of us already had our fill of[N]
the ashen coast and left.[AN]

[L]
You defected from the kingdom.[AN]

[MR]
Yeah[,] whole long story[,] boss.[6N]
Wasn't my first or second choice.[6N]
Didn't wanna fight a losing war.[AN]

[L]
Tsch.[.6] Whatever[,] then.[.6] I won't pry.[6N]
Did you receive word from the capital?[6N]
From the Apostle?[AN]

[MR]
Hahaha[,] the Apostle?[.6] Little lass has gone[N]
missing shortly after the war started.[6N]
Must've retreated to no-man's land.[AN]

[L]
But those ghostly soldiers she's summoned[Beat][N]
They've been appearing more as of late.[AN]

[MR]
You think I know anything 'bout those things?[6N]
I'm already humoring you 'cause there's[N]
nothing left for me.[AN]
You know I'm not privy to the details.[6N]
All I ask you is to stop asking me[N]
stupid questions[,] Lieutenant.[AN]

[L]
Tell me[,] Ser:[.4] How many supply convoys made[N]
it to you in the past three months?[AN]

[MR]
None.[.6] Hey[,] I didn't realize you cared so[N]
much about my squad.[.6] That's sweet.[AN]

[L]
I'm asking because I know none of them[N]
made it past our scouts.[.6] Nobody[N]
had the chance to reinforce.[AN]
Seven months and thousands slain.[6N]
And you fought like you still had[N]
something to protect.[AN]

[MR]
Yeah.[.6] We foraged from the forest[,][N]
might as well stick it to the end.[6N]
You want my last loaf of moldy bread?[6N]
Here[,] take it.[AN]

[MR]
I[Beat] Sigh[Beat] I don't know where the Emperor[N]
is.[.6] Nobody does[,] 'specially not a new[N]
recruit like me.[AN]
Look[,] these coasts are a wasteland.[6N]
Nothing but ash[,] cold[,] dead dreams[,][N]
and singing's out here.[AN] 

[ML]
Hold on[,] what was that?[6N]
What are you trying to pull?[AN]

[MR]
Out west[,] near the cliffs.[6N]
We were a royal platoon full of holdouts.[6N]
Seldom else saw the light of day.[AN]
Our captain was a bit of a rabblerouser.[6N]
By the end[,] we'd start singing songs[N]
in some bizarre ballad.[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]Go.[.6] Either way[,] we've no use for you.[.6][N]
Tell your Emperor what you've witnessed.[AN]

[MR]
Didn't I already tell you nobody's got[N]
a hold of him?[.6] Anyways[,] I may as[N]
well return to the kingdom.[AN][C]
I got nothing to fight for.[AN]

[ML]
If you truly want to absolve yourself[,][N]
then come with us.[.6] We need any hands[N]
we can get in this war.[AN]

[MR]
Yada-yada[,] I know.[.6] I can tell from[Beat] everything[N]
how this war's going for y'all.[6N]
I may as well ride this out.[AN][C]
Fight the losing war[,] you know?[AN][CSS]

[ML][MoveLeft]

[FL][Breve]
Really?[.6] We're just letting that bastard[N]
ride with us like that?[.6] She's a traitor[N]
to the crown![AN]

[MR]
Thanks.[.6] I tried.[AN][CSS]

[FL][CF][Ansgar]
Take it easy.[.6] We live another day[,] and[N]
with a new ally in tow![6N]
Ain't that enough?[AN][CSS]

[FL][CF][Hildr]
I[,] for one[,] am happy to have you[,] Ser.[.6N]
I believe that anybody can turn around[N]
given the chance.[AN][C]
Aaaaand you can start by telling me all[N]
about your platoon![AN]

[MR]
So be it[,] then.[.6] I'll fight with the kingdom.[6N]
This I swear.[AN]

Fall back to the rendezvous point.[6N]
It's time to regroup with the rest of the army.[6N]
We'll need everyone for what comes next.[AN]

Ulrich![.6] You're back at last![AN]

And yet your boots still track ash[N]
across this soil.[6N]

More importantly[,] who's the lass?[.6][N]
I don't recall her leaving the fortress.[AN]

General.[.6] You lot are a sight for sore eyes.[6N]
This is BOSSNAMeidk[,] she's a deserter from[N]
the empire.[AN]

Can we really trust her?[AN]

Well[,] I defected from the kingdom first.[6N]
I was a bluescarf for four years[,] and[N]
an Imperial for less than three months.[AN]

People change when the noose tightens.[6N]
I've seen worse turn back.[AN]

Very well[,] BOSSNAMEidk.[6N]
Welcome to our ranks.[.6] You understand[N]
that these are trying times.[AN]
Any distrust will have you immediately[N]
thrown out.[AN]


Any updates on the captains?

Captain Brudet and Stroganoff[Beat] Their location[N]
is still unknown.[.6] Ever since they went[N]
missing[,] it appears they've been moving.[AN]

You think it's some desertion[,] then?[AN]

I could not think of a less likely[N]
pair to betray the empire together.[6N]
The empire must have them hostage.[AN]

stood up to the Empire that she was fated[N]

We survive now[,] and an opportune for her[N]
return will present itself.[AN]

[ML]
Any ideas for how we'll do that first part[,][N]
Malcolm?[.6] In the meantime[,] all we can do is[N]
wait for the noble's response.[AN]

Yes[,] I am sure he will welcome your army[N]
with open arms.[AN]

Captain Raial![AN][CSS]

[ML][MoveLeft]
[FFL][MoveFarLeft]
Lord Reinier wants nothing to do with our[N]
forces[,] even after passing the letter.[6N]
He thinks us almost the Imperial army[,] I see.[AN][CF]

[L]
Damn it![AN]

[MR]
What an unwise decision.[AN]

[L]
We're quickly running out of options[Beat][N]
I know.[.6] We send off a few scouts and[N]
uncover the royal army's location.[AN][MML]
After that[,] we'll have them receive a message[N]
to form an alliance.[.6] They're desperate:[.4][N]
they can't say no here.[AN]

[MR]
Is that not what the first attempt was?[6N]
To repeat an option with a known result[N]
is the definition of foolishness.[AN]
You think the kingdom will simply join us?[6N]
Without the golden-eyed demon as our[N]
figurehead[,] asking nicely will not work here.[AN]

[ML]
Hell[,] just say it.[.6] What do you propose we do?[6N]
Because you've obviously been trying to[N]
lead us into asking about your plan.[AN]

[MR]
The Wreyvian army will not join us without[N]
a catalyst.[.6] They have little reason to trust[N]
us[,] Raial.[.6] We must give them one.[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]What are you saying?[6N]
Quit your games![AN]

[MR]
We take a noble of the Kingdom hostage.[6N]
That aforementioned Reinier sounds like a[N]
good start[,] wouldn't you agree?[AN]
We offer him in exchange for a formal[N]
meeting with the Wreyvians.[6N]
From there[,] diplomacy can resume.[AN]

[ML]
You want to blackmail them into a peace talk?[6N]
This is insanity[,] Graham.[AN]

[MR]
It is the only way[,] Raial.[.6][N]
There stands no chance of them parleying[N]
with us otherwise.[AN]

[ML]
Kidnapping one of their own isn't[N]
going to have them trust us.[6N]
They'll hate us.[AN]

[MR]
Trust?[.6] They need us and do not know it.[.6][N]
Their forces crumble apart.[.6] Their king is dead.[6N]
Their spirits are fractured.[AN]
We do not need to break the kingdom;[6N]
it has been broken for us.[.6] All we have[N]
to do is show them our worth,[AN]
and proceed to direct the pieces.[AN]

[ML]
You talk like you're playing with a puzzle.[.6][N]
This hostage scheme isn't some grand[N]
strategy[,] Graham.[.6] It's desperation[Beat][AN]

[MR]
We find ourselves in a position similar to[N]
the royal army.[.6] We are on borrowed time.[AN]

[ML]
Graham[Beat] You always talked about a new[N]
Aeteria--[.4]one with mercy, with honor.[.6][N]
Was that just another lie you fed to her?[AN]
To all of us?[AN]

[MR]
Princess Sylmeria was our star[,] yes.[6N]
But a star alone cannot burn away a[N]
tyrant's shadow.[AN]
The people need to see more than hope now.[6N]
They need to see results.[AN]

[ML]
So you'll risk all-out war with the kingdom?![6N]
Throw a lit match on a powder keg just[N]
just so you can drag them to the table?![AN]

[MR]
Raial.[.6] I would rather a scorched road than[N]
no road at all.[AN]

[ML]
You think they'll stand behind you when you[N]
start using nobles as bargaining chips?[AN]

[MR]
They will when they see it works.[.6][N]
They will when we[,] a unified force[,][N]
finally push the empire back.[AN]

[ML]
Tell me[,] what happens if this Reinier dies in[N]
our custody?[.6] What happens when Wreyvine sends[N]
tons of knights to avenge them?[AN][C]
What happens when blood spills and there's[N]
no turning back?[AN]

[MR]
First of all:[.4] Wreyvine has no knights to spare[N]
for some fantastical revenge plot.[.6][N]
Second:[.4] then we adapt.[AN][C]
As we always have[,] Raial.[AN]

[FFR][LoadVerna]

the Liberation Army.[AN][CSS]

[MR][MoveRight]

Reverend[,] the guards are sweeping the bridge[N]

slip through the hills and get the noble.[AN]
Reinier lays guarded in that castle.[6N]
Should be an easy catch[,] that old oaf[Beat][N]
We'll move at your order.[AN]

[ML]
You've already--[.4]you're going to drag this lord[N]
out in chains[,] and expect that to spark[N]
an alliance?![AN]

[MR]
Not an alliance[,] Raial.[.6] A negotiation.[6N]
Once they hear our terms[,] they will[N]
have no choice but to listen.[AN]
And Lady Verna.[.6] We need them to see us.[6N]
Let them believe we aim for their treasury[,][N]
and cut through like a knife.[AN]
They will have no chance to intercept.[6N]
Raial[,] I beg you to place your faith[N]
in me.[.6] For this rebellion.[6N]

all-out war with the kingdom?[6N]

shackles and return to us.[AN]

Raial.[.6] I would rather a scorched road than[N]
no road at all.[.6] This is what we settled on[N]

[MR][MoveRight]
You think they'll still stand behind you[N]

They will when they see it works.[.6][N]
They will when we[,] a unified force[,][N]

[FR][MoveRight]
Peace[,] Stroganoff.[.6] They risked their[N]

hear them out.[AN]

[FL]
We are Aeteria's Liberation Army[,] those[N]
who will bring down Emperor Selwyn and his[N]
reign upon Ideon.[AN]

[L]
I'm Raial of Vintrus[,] a captain of a mercenary[N]
band.[.6] The pompous man's Graham of[N]
the Noctum Order.[AN]

[R]
[Pause]What a fascinating division.[AN]

[FR]
And what the hell're ye all doin'[N]
in the kingdom?[AN]

[R]
We were driven here by Imperial soldiers.[6N]
There was a battle at the bridge[,] and[N]
a Consul took our leader[Beat][AN]

[R]
I will speak plain:[.4] what does your[N]
[OpenQuote]Liberation Army" exactly intend[N]
to do with the kingdom guard?[AN][CSS]

[FL][MoveLeft]
Captain Brudet.[AN]
We intend to unite the continent under[N]
one banner[,] fighting side-by-side[N]
with the kingdom.[AN]

[FL]
The fight's already bigger than any one army.[6N]
If we want the throne out of Selwyn's grip[,][N]
we have to do this.[AN]

[R]
You say that like it's noble.[.6][N]
What do you know of our war[,] Raial[N]
of Vintrus?[AN]

[FL]
More than you think.[.6] We bled from the[N]
same Imperial soldiers and were cut with[N]
the same blades.[AN]

[FR]
Sure[,] that's valiant an' all.[.6] But[N]
how do we know ye want cut our backs?[AN]

[R]
[Pause]Forgive me for prying.[.6][N]
The Noctum Order is a directive dedicated[N]
to[Beat] disruption[,] am I correct?[AN]
They operate outside the Imperial court[N]
and outside any noble's claim to legitimacy.[6N]
Just who are you[,] Graham?[AN]

[L]
A traitor[,] if you asked the court.[6N]
A rat[,] if you asked the Consuls.[6N]
And a threat[,] if you asked the Emperor.[AN]
We of the Order were cast out personally[N]
by the Emperor for dissent.[6N]
The court branded us all as radicals.[AN]

[FL]
We're not asking for loyalty here.[6N]
You see how Wreyvine begins to crack.[6N][MoveFL]
We're offering an alliance![AN]

[R]
We are aware of the kingdom's wounds.[6N]
That is not what I question.[6N]
Precisely what does this alliance entail?[AN]

[R]
We strike the Emperor and the Apostle[N]
before their hold becomes unbreakable.[6N]
We dismantle their strongholds one by one.[AN]
We will rally all who have been disillusioned[N]
and restore the throne to the true heir[N]
of Aeteria.[AN]

[FR]
Strike the bastard[Beat] Hah![6N]
You don't lack for guts.[.6] I'll give ya that.[AN]

[R]
You've still not answered the real question.[6N]
How do we know you're not simply[N]
another faction chasing a throne?[AN]

[L]
We do not chase thrones[,] Captain Brudet.[6N]
We burn the chains that bind them and[N]
shackle the people.[AN]
Only through faith and blood can the[N]
lands of Ideon heal.[.6] And the[N]
step begins with our armies.[AN]

[FR]
Twist my arm[,] will ya?[.6] Now you're talkin'[N]
like one o' those preachers.[.6] An' I don't[N]
much like preachers.[AN][CSS]

[FL][MoveLeft]
Then listen to me instead[,] Captain.[6N]
I'm a blade-for-hire, and just about as[N]
far from Graham as one possible can be.[AN]
I've got no holy tongue or anything.[6N]
I just know what losing looks like[,][N]
and I know who put us there.[AN]
A shared enemy puts us as equals.[6N]
I know the kingdom will make for fine allies--[.4][N]
even the noisy man blundering hot air.[AN]

[FR][MoveFR]
Hot air?[.6] You wanna fight[,] huh?![6N]
I got enough strength left for you and[N]
that scraggly preachin' string bean.[AN]

[R]
Enough.[.6] She's correct[,] even if her[N]
tone is harsh.[.6] We must be honest[N]
with ourselves here.[AN]
Neither the kingdom or your Liberation[N]
Army can continue to stand alone[,] lest[N]
we get wiped by the empire.[AN]
But do you believe you can truly slay[N]
them both?[.6] The Emperor and the Apostle?[6N]
If the Emperor falls[,] who rises in his place?[AN]

[L]
Her name is Princess Sylmeria.[.6] She led our[N]
rebellion and was taken by the Consul.[6N]
She's the lost heir to Aeteria.[AN]
I don't know where exactly she is[,][N]
but she may be the last thread that[N]
ties any chance we have of peace.[AN]

[R]
You speak strategy[,] but what of the[N]
aftermath? Do you intend to place her[N]
on the throne?[AN][C]
After everything that will occur?[AN]

[FL]
I believe in Her Highness.[6N]
She walks the right path for[N]
Aeteria's bright future.[AN]

[R]
If what you say is[Beat] true[,][N]
and if the Imperial princess truly lives--[4N]
then we must move.[AN]

[L]
Do you know where the rest of the[N]
royal army is?[.6] You all have a big[N]
and fancy hideout[,] right?[AN]

[R]
After the Emperor's conquest[,] we were[N]
forced to scatter.[.6] We split off because[N]
of Captain Stroganoff's[Beat] little stunt.[AN]

[FR]
That really was my fault[,] huh?[6N]
Shit.[AN]

[R]
This[Beat] humility is a pleasant surprise.[6N]
I have been saying this the entire time.[AN]

[FR]
And damn your fancy speeches.[6N]
I still don't trust the priest[,] but[N]
if the Emperor falls by your hand,[AN]
I might just raise a toast![AN]

[FL]
You will find that this arrangement[N]
will prove invaluable in time.[AN]

[R]
This cause is no longer ours alone.[6N]
We will walk the long road with you[N]
and regroup with the royal army.[AN]
But make no mistake[,] rebels.[6N]
If you steer us wrong[,] we will[N]
strike you down ourselves.[AN]

[L]
Fair.[.6] I'd expect nothing less.[6N]
How about it?[.6] An alliance with the[N]
