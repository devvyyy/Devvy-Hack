Ugh[Beat] I can't believe I lost to[N]
that clown[Beat] And I guess my luck's[N]
finally run out now.[AN]

Wakey-wakey.[A]

[FR]
Uh[,] eggs and bakey?[AN]

[ML]
(Huh...? Am I actually awake...? Maybe I'm dead?[N]
Did they finally get me...? It's been many[N]
moons since[Beat][A][Clear]
Since the war started after Aeteria[N]
invaded Wreyvine... How am I...)[AN]

[MR]
By any chance[,] are you a fan of[N]
Ideonian mythology[,] madame?[AN]

[ML][MoveML]
What is your deal?![AN]

[R]
I am simply asking if you are[N]
well-educated[,] milady.[AN]

[FR]
[Pause]Ah[,] must we really deal with such[N]
hogwash again?[ClearFace][LoadYvonne]

[FR]
Oooooh, here comes Reverend Graham with yet[N]
another belter of a speech![.6] Pay[N]
attention, folks![AN][Clear]
We might even get to leave early this time.[AN]

[R][ClearFace][LoadPolly]
My beloved sister[Beat] Not everyone is as desensitized[N]
to aimless drivel as you are[Beat] I fear our[N]
caged bird may fall back into her slumber[Beat][AN]

[ML]
I'm in[Beat] a cell[Beat] Who are you?[.6] Even if you're part[N]
of the Aeterian army[,] you're not supposed to be here[Beat][N]
unless you're all here to execute me?[AN]
Is that it?[.6] Aeteria lets the circus perform[N]
executions now?[AN]

[R]
Circus?[.6] And assuming we are here for execution?[6N]
This one looks to be incredibly rude.[6N]
I understand our objective[,] but[Beat][AN][ClearFace][FR][ClearFace]

[MR][LoadGraham]
Now[,] now[,] Penny.[.6] The Order's mission is to recruit[N]
worthy adversaries who will aid us in our[N]
battle against the empire.[AN]

[ML]
Oh.[.6] So you want me to fight for your cause.[6N]
I suppose I must thank you for waking[N]
me up from that nightmare.[AN]

[MR]
One myth I'm particularly a fan of is the[N]
history of Ideon[Beat] the Four Champions[N]
of the Constellation.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveRight][FR][LoadPolly]

[FR]
Mm, actually, stop talking.[AN]

[MR]
But there is so much to say![AN]

[ML][MoveLeft]
I presume you're their leader?[.6] I'm not well-versed[N]
in that type of stuff[N] so I'd appreciate it[N]
if you went straight to the point.[AN]

[FR][ClearFace][LoadJaye]
With the Reverend?[.6] That's simply not happening.[AN][ClearFace][LoadPolly]

[R]
Well[,] you learn to read people through history[,][N]
madame.[.6] History always repeats itself, and the[N]
people will always continue fighting.[AN]
Take a look here at Penny:[.4] she is one like the[Beat][N]
Swordsman of Ideonian legend.[.6] Brooding, strong,[n]
yet distrustful and overly proud.[AN]

[FR]
Kill me.[AN]

[R]
Others I have seen are much like the Champion:[6N]
they're selfless, integral; yet arrogant[N]
to a fault.[AN]
I believe some are much one with the Vagrant--[.4][N]
wise yet uncaring, they'll always try their[N]
hardest to prove their worth.[AN]

[ML]
How perfectly poetic[Beat] I think I'm[N]
almost brought to tears.[AN]

[R]
Listen, "Chiffon".[.6] You seem like the Gallant.[6N]
The Gallant-iest Gallant who ever lived.[AN]

[ML]
What's that supposed to mean?[AN]

[R]
Weak, yet with unmatched power.[6N]
I presume you are affiliated with the Resistance[N]
army if you are imprisoned here?[AN]

[ML]
Nah, I was a hired merc before I got captured.[6N]
Some imperial bozo--[.4]the Viper--[.4]got me[,] though[Beat][N]
And now I have a bone to pick with him.[AN]

[FR][ClearFace][LoadYufka]
The Viper[Beat] You tell us you were arrested by[N]
Major General Haye himself?[AN]

[ML]
Yeah.[.6] Are you going to break me out of[N]
here or not?[.6] Who even are you guys?[AN]

[FR]
We are those of the Noctum Order[,] a[N]
humble group of magi freedom fighters[N]
exiled from the Imperial Court.[AN]
We aim to liberate Aeteria from the unjust[N]
grasp of Emperor Selwyn and Apostle Sylveria.[A][Clear]
Seven moons ago, they conquered Wreyvine for[N]
territory and retribution instead of tending[N]
to their own people.[AN]
Now, it is clear they know nothing of[N]
statecraft: the people of Aeteria are[N]
suffering in silence.[AN]
And for what? Many imperial soldiers have occupied[N]
the Wreyvian kingdom. It seems the Emperor[N]
intends to annex Wreyvine.[AN]

[R]
Seven moons since the invasion of the kingdom.[6N]
Twelve moons since the beginning of winter.[6N]
I fear a divine balance has been disrupted;[A][Clear]
Ideon has never seen such a long lapse[N]
of spring.[AN]

[FR]
With the Empress' untimely demise, Aeteria[N]
remains in turmoil. Yet the Emperor and[N]
Apostle do nothing for us, still...[A][Clear]
Why do they continue this lunacy?[AN]

[R]
This subjugation must end. We're looking for someone[N]
who can aid us in our fight against Aeteria.[6N]
You are esteemed in a militia, are you not?[AN]

[ML]
Right[,] but...[AN]

[R][ClearFace][LoadJaye]
A mercenary like you must've seen a lot[N]
of battles.[.6] I don't imagine you want to[N]
stay in this cell, either.[AN]

[ML]
[Mouth](It doesn't seem like I have a choice...[N]
These nutjobs are my best bet if I don't[n]
want to die here...)[A][Clear][Mouth]
Alright, I see.[.6] I'll come with you and[N]
fight for your cause.[.6] Is that all?[AN]

[R][ClearFace][LoadGraham]
If you truly will fight with us, then let us[N]
not waste any more time. There are more who[N]
need to be rescued.[AN]

[R]
Alright[,] stand back[,] friend![AN]

Imperial forces will be upon us soon to[N]
investigate the explosion.[.6] I suggest you[N]
get your bearings and equipment prepared.[AN]

[FR][MoveRight]
You have our thanks[,] truly[,] Ser Chiffon.[.6][N]
The Liberation efforts need any blade who will[N]
fight with us[,] and...[AN]

[L]
How did you all even get in here?[6N]
This place must be in the middle[N]
of nowhere[Beat][AN]

[FL]
Blew up the guard[,] blew up the doors,[N]
blew up your cell.[.6] Keep up.[AN]

[R][ClearFace][LoadGraham]
First things first.[.6] Let us all exit this prison[N]
floor. We must recruit all of the prisoners[N]
here and then proceed to a lower floor.[AN]
But thanks to Jaye's problem-solving,[N]
there are now many imperial soldiers who aim[N]
to follow and decimate.[A][Clear]
May the glorious wings of the Silver Serpent[N]
bless us tonight.[AN]

Get a move on, Reverend![.6] You wanted me to[N]

rescue themselves.[AN][Clear]
And I don't know about you, but I'm not gonna[N]
wait around for the guards to catch me again.[AN][CSS][MoveFarFarRight]

[MR][LoadChiffon]
Phew[,] that's the end of that.[6N]
They couldn't stop us.[AN]

[ML][LoadGraham]
Excellent results as expected.[.6] But are you[N]
comfortable in this position[,] running ahead?[AN]

[MR]
My apologies, Reverend.[.6] It's just what feels[N]
natural to me in battle.[AN]

[ML]
Do not apologize. You led the forces and secured the[N]
Order a glorious victory today.[.6] And what[N]
manner of witchcraft did you display in battle?[AN]

[MR]
No clue[,] honestly.[.6] It's just a thing[N]
I've always had.[AN]

[ML]
Ah[,] a "thing".[AN]

[MR]
So now we've three more for the cause, hm?[6N]
There sure are a lot of people down here in[N]
these prisons.[.6] Most aren't even armed.[AN]

[ML][MoveFarLeft][L][LoadYufka]
The empire has been increasing surveillance and[N]
authority ever since the war began.[6N]
It is strange[Beat][A][Clear]
I presume the Emperor is filled with paranoia[N]
at the thought of the citizens rising.[AN]

[MR]
He should be.[.6] We'll take him down.[AN]

[FL]
A rightful step forward[,] but I pray your hubris[N]
does not lead to your downfall.[.6] With your[N]
powers[,] I sense potential.[AN]
[Pause]We shall address your combat skill[,][N]
your battle expertise[,] and your leadership[N]
capabilities in these upcoming battles.[AN]

[MR]
Is that so?[.6] Then I won't disappoint you[,][N]
Reverend.[.6] Neither you, Minister.[.6] I'll make[N]
sure I'm worthy to fight alongside you all.[AN]

[FL]
A pledge I am sure you will keep[,] Ser.[6N]
Allow me to mark this down.[AN]

[MR]
You and the Minister always seem to be[N]
writing things down.[AN]

[FL]
It is only natural to monitor the time we take.[6N]
If we are late, we miss opportunities.[6N]
Yet if we are too early,[AN]
there will be but no opportunity to miss.[A][Clear]
Now, Ser, what action would you suggest we take?[AN]

[MR]
Honestly[,] I haven't an idea[Beat] But I think you[N]
want us to move onto the lower floors and[N]
recruit a few more jailed here.[AN]

[ML]
That is the right answer.[.6] Sound the bell.[AN][CF]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[L]
Yes[,] he is always like this.[.6] My sincere[N]
apologies[,] Ser.[AN][CF]

[MR]
This is truly troublesome[,] General Opal.[6N]
First, we cannot catch the Resistance[N]
leaders in the city,[AN]
and now there are prisoners breaking out[N]
of our very cells?[.6] The Wreyvian invasion[N]
must have put us short on men...[AN]
or perhaps this new age of soldiers is[N]
lacking in competence![AN]

[ML]
Major Haye[.6]. You may be a spearhead to the new[N]
age of recruits[,] but do remember that you[,][N]
too[,] are part of this new age.[AN]
To think Aeteria is in such a pitiable state...[6N]
I keep my ideals and hopes close to my heart,[N]
yet the future looks to be naught but gray.[A][Clear]
I am uncertain of the empire's future.[AN]

[MR]
Oh, to think the world can shake a heart as[N]
stalwart as yours, General.[.6] That fills my[N]
heart with terror for the future.[AN]
I fear an uprising is coming...[.6] And there is[N]
not much we, as simple imperial soldiers,[N]
can do to cease the collapse.[A][Clear]
But trust in me. I will remain loyal[N]
to Aeteria to the end.[AN]

[ML]
Hah![.6] Do not be so sure of yourself, Major.[6N]
You are tasked to investigate the source of[N]
the uprising.[AN]
Where are their whereabouts? What locations could[N]
they feasibly be using as hideouts? And...[6N]
Deduce the identities of their leaders.[AN]
I can only hope that your heart does[N]
not fracture[,] Major.[AN]

[MR]
Never, General. My heart is always for the empire.[6N]
Consider it done.[.6] I will not fail Aeteria.[AN]
