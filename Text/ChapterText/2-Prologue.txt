## PrologueChiffonExplanation
Chiffon's personal skill allows her[N]
to activate [ToggleRed]Overdrive[ToggleRed] after[N]
initiating combat with 2 stacks.[A][C]
Overdrive significantly boosts[N]
her Spd and movement, and[N]
continually refreshes her.[A][C]
Each round of combat consumes[N]
1 stack on initiation to grant[N]
her another action.[A][C]
Note that this stack isn't consumed[N]
if she kills the enemy, leading[N]
to chain combats.[A]

Oooooh[,] here comes Reverend Graham with yet[N]

My beloved sister[Beat] Not everyone is as[N]

I fear our caged bird may fall back[N]

Who are you?[.6] Even if you're part of[N]

Unless you mean it's time for my execution?[6N]

Haha![.6] The inmate's got a retort![AN]

[R][ClearFace][FR][ClearFace]

[MR][LoadGraham]
Now[,] now[,] Penny.[.6] The Order's mission is to[N]
recruit worthy adversaries who will aid us[N]

[ML]
Oh.[.6] So you want me to fight for your cause.[6N]
I suppose I must thank you for waking[N]
me up from that nightmare.[AN]

[MR]
One myth I'm particularly a fan of is the[N]
history of Ideon[Beat] the Four Champions[N]
of the Constellation.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveRight][FR][LoadPolly]

[FR]
Mm[,] actually[,] stop talking.[AN]

[MR]
But there is so much to say about[N]
the vast history of this world![AN][CSS]

[ML][MoveLeft]
I presume you're their leader?[.6] I'm not[N]

I'd appreciate it if you went[AN]
straight to the point.[AN]

[FR][ClearFace][LoadJaye]
With the Reverend?[.6] That's simply not[N]
happening[,] sorry.[AN][ClearFace][LoadPolly]

[R]
Well[,] you learn to read people through[N]
history[,] madame.[.6] History and people[N]
always repeat like clockwork.[AN]
Take a look here at Penny:[.4] she is one like[N]
the Swordsman of Ideonian legend.[.6] Brooding[,][N]
strong[,] yet a lone wolf.[AN]

[FR]
[_K][_i][_l][_l][_SP][_m][_e][_Dot][AN]

How perfectly poetic[Beat] I think I'm[N]
almost brought to tears[Beat] or something.[AN]

[R]
Heed me[,] Ser.[.6] You very much embody the[N]
Gallant.[.6] I dare say you are the most[N]
Gallant-iest Gallant who ever lived.[AN]

[L]
What's that supposed to mean?[AN]

[R]
Weak[,] yet with unmatched power.[.6] One who--[AN]

[FR][CF][Yufka]
The Reverend is saying that he believes[N]
that you would fit perfectly in our group.[AN]

[R]
Yes[Beat] I presume you are affiliated with[N]
the Resistance army if you are[N]
imprisoned here?[AN]

[L]
Nah[,] I was a hired merc before I got captured.[6N]
Some Imperial bozo they call the Viper[N]
got me[,] though[Beat][AN]
I have a bone to pick with him.[6N]
The moment I get outta here[,] I swear[N]
I won't miss next time[Beat]![AN]

[FR][ClearFace][LoadYufka]
The Viper[Beat] You mean to tell us you were[N]
arrested by Major General Hayes himself?[AN]

[L]
Yeah.[.6] Are you going to break me out of[N]
here or not?[.6] Who even are you guys?[AN]

[FR]
We are those of the Noctum Order[,] a[N]
humble group of magi freedom fighters[N]
exiled from the Imperial court.[AN]
We aim to liberate Aeteria from the[N]
unjust grasp of Emperor Selwyn and[N]
Apostle Sylveria.[AN]
Seven moons ago, they conquered Wreyvine[N]
for conquest and retribution instead of[N]
tending to their own people.[AN]
Now[,] it is clear they know nothing of[N]
statecraft:[.4] the people of Aeteria[N]
suffer in boundless silence.[AN]
And for what?[.6] Many imperial soldiers occupy[N]
the Wreyvian kingdom.[.6] The Emperor[N]
intends to annex the kingdom.[AN]

[R]
Seven moons since the invasion.[6N]
Twelve moons since the beginning of winter.[6N]
I fear a divine balance has been disrupted;[A][Clear]
Ideon has never seen such a long lapse[N]
of bloom in her history.[AN]

[FR]
With the Empress' untimely demise[,] Aeteria[N]
bleeds in turmoil.[.6] Yet the Emperor and[N]
Apostle do nothing for us[,] still[Beat][AN]
Why do they continue with this lunacy?[6N]
What is happening beneath the curtains[N]
of the Imperial court?[AN]

[R]
This subjugation must end.[.6] We look for[N]
any who can aid us in our fight[N]
against the empire.[AN]
You are capable in the art of warfare[,][N]
are you not?[.6] What say you nock your[N]
bolts as one of us?[AN]

[L]
Right[,] but[Beat][AN]

stay in this cell either.[AN]

Alright[,] I see.[.6] I'll come with you and[N]
fight for your cause.[.6] Is that all?[AN]

[R][ClearFace][LoadGraham]
If you truly will fight with us[,] then let us[N]
not waste any more time.[.6] There are more who[N]
need to be rescued on this floor.[AN]
Our objective here is to rescue one of[N]

The one called the closest to[N]
the[Beat] Swordsman.[.6] Or whatever.[AN]

[ML]
Please forget about that.[.6] What nonsense[N]
did he call you again?[.6] Something like[Beat][N]
the Gallant-iest Gallant?[.6] Ugh.[AN]

[MR]
Yeah.[.6] I don't usually know things[,][N]
but even that's outside my 'know-things'[N]
part of my brain.[AN]

[ML]
I can attest to his clownery[,] if anything.[6N]
We've known him for years[Beat] and he's[N]
always been this way.[AN]

[MR]
Must be a pretty tight-knit group[,] then.[6N]
So what exactly is this Order?[.6][N]
Are you all exiles from the court?[AN]

[ML]
Mostly.[.6] This has been brewing for years before;[.4][N]
disgruntled nobles[,] exiles[,] you know[,] all[N]
of the Reverend's shady connections.[AN]
But Emperor Selwyn's attack on Wreyvine was[N]
the catalyst.[.6] Fath--[.4]Lord Mariya[,][N]
the Reverend[,] and the Minister gathered us.[AN]
They said they wanted to unite the empire[N]
under one vision[,] beginning by removing[N]
the Emperor from power.[AN]

[MR]
Quite an ambitious plan you got.[AN]

[ML]
Enough about me[,] arbalest.[.6][N]
Your crossbows[,] though[Beat] I've never[N]
seen anybody fight with those.[AN]

[MR]
Yeah[,] arbalests aren't too common around[N]
these parts of Ideon.[.6] Not that they're[N]
common in the kingdom either.[AN]

[ML]
Such skill.[.6] I'll keep an eye on[N]
you[,] mercenary.[AN]

[MR]
You seem to really be enjoying this battle.[6N]
Aren't you a holy woman?[AN]

[ML]
How could I not?[.6] House Mariya was[N]
known throughout the land for its[N]
honor and its valiant warriors![AN]

[MR]
Was[Beat]?[.6] I'm not much for nobility[N]
and all its fancy high-society stuff.[6N]
A lot of houses disbanded[,] right?[AN]

[ML]
Perhaps [OpenQuote]Was" isn't the most accurate.[6N]
But my sister and I are now the only[N]
remnants of House Mariya.[AN]

[MR]
Sheesh[,] that sounds like a bummer.[6N]
I think one of my past employers told[N]
me all about the aftermath.[AN]

[ML]
[OpenQuote]Bummer" is an understatement[,] Ser.[6N]
But it is of little worry for me now.[6N]
One day[,] I know my house will be restored![AN]

[MR]
Well?[.6] Follow my lead if you wanna[N]
get a headstart on this restoration thing.[AN]

[ML]
May moonlight guide us.[6N]
Let us see what you're made of![AN]
