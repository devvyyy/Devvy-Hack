[FR]
Uh[,] eggs and bakey?[AN]

[ML]
(Huh...? Am I actually awake...?[N]
Maybe I'm dead?[N]
Did they finally get me...?)[AN]
(It's been many moons since[Beat][N]
Since the war started after Aeteria[N]
invaded Wreyvine... How am I...)[AN]

By any chance[,] are you a fan of[N]

[ML][MoveML]
What is your deal?![AN]

[R]
I am simply asking if you are[N]
well-educated[,] Ser.[AN]

[FR]
[Pause]Ah[,] must we really deal with such[N]
hogwash again?[AN][ClearFace][LoadYvonne]

[FR]
Oooooh, here comes Reverend Graham with yet[N]
another belter of a speech![.6] Pay[N]
attention, folks![AN][Clear]
We may even get to leave early this time.[AN]

[R][ClearFace][LoadPolly]
My beloved sister[Beat] Not everyone is as[N]
desensitized to such aimless drivel as[N]
you are[Beat][AN][C]
I fear our caged bird may fall back[N]
into her slumber[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Who are you?[.6] Even if you're part of[N]
the Aeterian army[,] you're not[N]
supposed to be here.[AN]
Unless you mean it's time for my execution?[6N]
Is that it?[.6] Aeteria lets the circus perform[N]
executions now?[AN]

[R]
I understand our objective[,] but[Beat][AN][ClearFace][FR][ClearFace]

[MR][LoadGraham]
Now[,] now[,] Penny.[.6] The Order's mission is to[N]
recruit worthy adversaries who will aid us[N]
in our battle against the empire.[AN]

[ML]
Oh.[.6] So you want me to fight for your cause.[6N]
I suppose I must thank you for waking[N]
me up from that nightmare.[AN]

[MR]
One myth I'm particularly a fan of is the[N]
history of Ideon[Beat] the Four Champions[N]
of the Constellation.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveRight][FR][LoadPolly]

[FR]
Mm, actually, stop talking.[AN]

[MR]
But there is so much to say about[N]
the vast history of this world![AN][CSS]

[ML][MoveLeft]
I presume you're their leader?[.6] I'm not[N]
well-versed in that type of stuff[,] so[N]
I'd appreciate it if you went[AN]
straight to the point.[AN]

[FR][ClearFace][LoadJaye]
With the Reverend?[.6] That's simply not[N]
happening.[AN][ClearFace][LoadPolly]

[R]
Well[,] you learn to read people through[N]
history[,] madame.[.6] History and people[N]
always repeat like clockwork.[AN]
Take a look here at Penny:[.4] she is one like[N]
the Swordsman of Ideonian legend.[.6] Brooding[,][N]
strong[,] yet a lone wolf.[AN]

[FR]
Kill me.[AN]

[R]
Others I have seen are much like the[N]
Champion:[.6] selfless, integral;[.4] yet[N]
arrogant to a fault.[AN]
Some are much one with the Vagrant--[.4][N]
wise yet uncaring[,] they'll always try[N]
their hardest to prove their worth.[AN]

[ML]
How perfectly poetic[Beat] I think I'm[N]
almost brought to tears.[AN]

[R]
Heed me[,] Ser.[.6] You very much embody the[N]
Gallant.[.6] I dare say you are the most[N]
Gallant-iest Gallant who ever lived.[AN]

[ML]
What's that supposed to mean?[AN]

[R]
Weak[,] yet with unmatched power.[.6] One who--[AN]

[FR][CF][Yufka]
The Reverend is saying that he[N]
believes that you would fit perfectly[N]
in our group.[AN]

[R]
Yes[Beat] I presume you are affiliated with[N]
the Resistance army if you are[N]
imprisoned here?[AN]

[ML]
Nah[,] I was a hired merc before I got captured.[6N]
Some imperial bozo they call the Viper[N]
got me[,] though[Beat][AN]
I have a bone to pick with him.[6N]
The moment I get outta here[,] I swear[N]
I won't miss this time[Beat]![AN]

[FR][ClearFace][LoadYufka]
The Viper[Beat] You mean to tell us you were[N]
arrested by Major General Hayes himself?[AN]

[ML]
Yeah.[.6] Are you going to break me out of[N]
here or not?[.6] Who even are you guys?[AN]

[FR]
We are those of the Noctum Order[,] a[N]
humble group of magi freedom fighters[N]
exiled from the Imperial Court.[AN]
We aim to liberate Aeteria from the[N]
unjust grasp of Emperor Selwyn and[N]
Apostle Sylveria.[A][Clear]
Seven moons ago, they conquered Wreyvine for[N]
territory and retribution instead of tending[N]
to their own people.[AN]
Now[,] it is clear they know nothing of[N]
statecraft:[.4] the people of Aeteria[N]
suffer in boundless silence.[AN]
And for what?[.6] Many imperial soldiers occupy[N]
the Wreyvian kingdom.[.6] The Emperor[N]
intends to annex the kingdom.[AN]

[R]
Seven moons since the invasion.[6N]
Twelve moons since the beginning of winter.[6N]
I fear a divine balance has been disrupted;[A][Clear]
Ideon has never seen such a long lapse[N]
of bloom in her history.[AN]

[FR]
With the Empress' untimely demise[,] Aeteria[N]
remains in turmoil.[.6] Yet the Emperor and[N]
Apostle do nothing for us, still[Beat][A][Clear]
Why do they continue with this lunacy?[6N]
What is happening beneath the curtains[N]
of the Imperial court?[AN]

[R]
This subjugation must end.[.6] We look for[N]
any who can aid us in our fight[N]
against the empire.[AN]
You are capable in the art of warfare[,][N]
are you not?[.6] What say you draw your[N]
blade as one of us?[AN]

[ML]
Right[,] but[Beat]AN]

[R][ClearFace][LoadJaye]
A mercenary like you must've seen a lot[N]
of battles.[.6] I don't imagine you want to[N]
stay in this cell either.[AN]

[ML]
[Mouth](It doesn't seem like I have a choice...[N]
These nutjobs are my best bet if I don't[n]
want to die here...)[A][Clear][Mouth]
Alright, I see.[.6] I'll come with you and[N]
fight for your cause.[.6] Is that all?[AN]

[R][ClearFace][LoadGraham]
If you truly will fight with us[,] then let us[N]
not waste any more time.[.6] There are more who[N]
need to be rescued on this floor.[AN]
Our objective here is to rescue one of[N]
our own in the lowest floor.[.6] Lend[N]
us your strength[,] and we will lend ours.[AN][CF][Jaye]

[R]
Alright[,] stand back[,] friend![AN]

I suggest you gather your bearings.[AN][CSS]

You have our thanks[,] truly[,] Ser Chiffon.[.6][N]
The Liberation efforts need any blade who will[N]
fight with us[,] and[Beat][AN]

How did you all even get in here?[6N]
This place must be in the middle[N]
of nowhere[Beat][AN]

[FL]
Blew up the guard[,] blew up the doors,[N]
blew up your cell.[.6] Keep up![AN]

[FR]
First things first.[.6] Let us all exit this prison[N]
floor. We must recruit all of the prisoners[N]
here and then proceed to a lower floor.[AN]
But thanks to Jaye's problem-solving,[N]
there are now many imperial soldiers who aim[N]
to follow and decimate.[A][Clear]
May the glorious wings of the Silver Serpent[N]
bless us tonight.[AN]

[MR][LoadChiffon]
Phew[,] that's the end of that.[6N]
They couldn't stop us.[AN]

[ML][LoadGraham]
Excellent results as expected.[.6] But are you[N]
comfortable in this position[,] running ahead?[AN]

[MR]
Sorry[,] Reverend.[.6] It's just what feels[N]
natural to me in battle.[AN]

[ML]
Do not apologize.[.6] You led the forces and[N]
secured the Order a glorious victory[N]
today.[.6] But I do wonder[Beat][AN]
What manner of witchcraft did you display[N]
in battle?[.6] It is nothing like any spell[N]
or magic I have ever seen.[AN]

[MR]
No clue[,] honestly.[.6] It's just a thing[N]
I've always had.[AN]

[ML]
Ah[,] yes[Beat] A [OpenQuote]thing".[AN]

[MR]
So now we've three more for the cause[,] hm?[6N]
There sure are a lot of people down here in[N]
these prisons.[.6] Most aren't even armed.[AN][CSS]

[ML][MoveFarLeft][L][LoadYufka]
The empire has been establishing its[N]
authority ever since the war began.[6N]
It is strange[Beat][A][Clear]
Only God knows what the Emperor is up to[,][N]
ever since he took over the kingdom.[AN]

[MR]
I don't know anything[,] but if this[N]
keeps up[,] we'll take him down.[AN]

[FL]
A rightful step forward[,] but I pray your hubris[N]
does not lead to your downfall.[.6] With your[N]
powers[,] I sense a great potential.[AN]
[Pause]We shall address your combat skill[,][N]
your battle expertise[,] and your leadership[N]
capabilities in these upcoming battles.[AN]

[MR]
Is that so?[.6] Then I won't disappoint you[,][N]
Reverend.[.6] Neither you, Minister.[.6] I'll make[N]
sure I'm worthy to fight alongside you all.[AN]

[FL]
A pledge I am sure you will keep[,] Ser.[6N]
Allow me to mark this down.[AN]

[MR]
You and the Minister always seem to be[N]
writing things down.[AN]

[FL]
It is only natural to monitor the time we take.[6N]
If we are late, we miss opportunities.[6N]
Yet if we are too early,[AN]
there will be but no opportunity to miss.[A][Clear]
Now[,] Ser[,] what action would you suggest we[N]
take?[.6] Speak your mind:[.6] doubt is always[N]
the first step towards revelation.[AN]

[MR]
Honestly[,] I haven't an idea[Beat] But I doubt[N]
you're simply done after recruiting a[N]
few people in these floors.[AN]
I think you want us to move onto the lower[N]
floors and recruit a few more jailed here.[6N]
It'd be the smart thing to do[,] anyways.[AN]

[FL]
That is what I expected.[.6] Sound the bell.[AN][CF]

[MR]

Yes[,] he is always like this.[.6] My sincere[N]

First[,] we cannot catch the Resistance[N]
leaders in the city,[AN]
and now there are prisoners breaking out[N]
of our very cells?[.6] The Wreyvian invasion[N]
must have put us short on men...[AN]
or perhaps it is that this new age of[N]
soldiers is lacking in competence![AN]

[ML]
Major Hayes[.6]. You may be a spearhead to the new[N]
age of recruits[,] but do remember that you[,][N]
too[,] are part of this new age.[AN]
To think Aeteria is in such a pitiable state...[6N]
I keep my ideals and hopes close to my heart,[N]
yet the future looks to be naught but gray.[A][Clear]
For the first time in so many years[,][N]
I find myself uncertain of the[N]
empire's future.[AN]

[MR]
Oh, to think the world can shake a heart as[N]
stalwart as yours[,] General.[.6] That fills my[N]
heart with terror for what's coming.[AN]
I fear an uprising is coming[Beat] And there is[N]
not much we[,] as simple Imperial soldiers[,][N]
can do to cease the collapse.[A][Clear]
But place your trust in me.[.6] I will remain loyal[N]
to Aeteria to the end[,] no matter what lunacy[N]
washes over Ideon.[AN]

[ML]
Hah![.6] Do not be so sure of yourself[,] Major.[6N]
You are tasked to investigate the source of[N]
the uprising.[AN]
Where are their whereabouts?[.6] Where could[N]
they feasibly hide?[.6] And[Beat][6N]
Deduce the identities of their leaders.[AN][C]
I can only hope that your heart does[N]
not fracture in two[,] Major.[AN]
