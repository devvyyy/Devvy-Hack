feeling alright[,] Your Highness?[AN]

[ML]
As alright as I possibly can be.[6N]
I should be trembling[,] but I'm not.[6N]
I'm still standing[,] and that's enough.[AN]
Everything in my mind[Beat] I feel like I know[N]
everything I need to.[.6] There's nothing left[N]
to fear but failure.[.6] And we won't fail.[AN][C]
Everything behind us has led here.[6N]
The new age of Aeteria is so close[Beat][AN]

[MR]
Soon these battles will draw to a close[,][N]

Okay[,] you know what?[.6] We've all marched[N]

Your Highness[,] you were acting strange earlier.[6N]
What did you deduce[Beat]?[.6] Do you think that[N]
perhaps the Warden would fight with us?[AN]

If the Warden was on our side,[.4] they'd[N]

[Pause]You're here to stop us.[AN]

[MR]
I knew if anybody were to plough towards[N]
the Bastion[,] it would be you.[6N]
It had to be you.[AN]

[CSS]
[FL][MoveLeft][MoveLeft]
Lady Vida[,] why[Beat]?[AN]

[MR]
You've known.[AN]

[L]
[CloseEyes]
[Beat][AN]

[MR]
Chiffon.[.6] You've always closed your eyes[N]
when afraid.[.6] You still do.[AN]

[L]
You--[.4]You died[,] Lady Vida.[6N]
Your spirit and essence are with me[,][N]
within this etherium.[AN]
Consul Maynard killed you with a single[N]
flash of light.[.6] I still see it flicker[N]
every night.[AN]

[MR]
The Consul spared me[,] took me back[N]
to the Bastion.[.6] The Apostle was mortified.[6N]
But she healed me.[AN]
Do you understand?[.6] I[Beat] made a choice.[6N]
Not for myself[,] little light.[6N]
For you[,] and only you.[AN]

[L]
But[Beat] There's no way.[6N]
The Apostle[,] she must've used her powers[N]
or something[Beat][AN]

[MR]
Precisely.[AN]

[FL]
Your Highness[Beat] This is no mirage.[6N]
I fear this is the truth.[AN]

[L][MoveLeft]
Then[Beat] But![.6] I don't understand![6N]
Why the hell are you standing with[N]
the empire?![AN][C]
What kind of twisted deal did my[N]
sister force you to--[AN]

[MR]
It was a difficult choice[,] but a[N]
necessary one.[.6] I underwent the same[N]
transformation as the man beside you.[AN]

[FL]
[Beat][AN]

[MR]
Apostle Sylveria's powers are beyond us now.[6N]
We are alive[,] yes[Beat] But we lack[N]
a crucial construct.[AN]

[FL]
[Pause]And that is?[AN]

[MR]
Soul.[.6] A reaper's carving;[.4] alive[,] without[N]
the ties to humanity that we bore.[6N]
She reached beyond the shores of death.[AN]
We can't ever return fully from the[N]
Serpent's flame.[.6] That is a folly[N]
even the most mystic can't solve.[AN]

[FL]
Then[,] I really am[Beat][AN]

[MR]
You feel it too[,] don't you?[6N]
That stillness under your skin.[.6][N]
That inability to ache[,] cry[,] scream.[AN]
In a way[,] we are no different than[N]
the rest of the Apostle's creations.[6N]
We feel echoes[,] and never fullness.[AN]

[L][OpenEyes]
Apsiel[Beat]?[AN]

[CSS][L][CF][Gorlois]
That explains how you vanish with[N]
a casted shadow apropos of nothing.[6N]
That's why we couldn't sense you.[AN]
There was simply nothing to detect.[AN]

[FL]
So we have obsidian hearts.[AN]

[CSS][L][CF][Chiffon]
Then why are you here?[.6] Why even speak[N]
to me if you're hollow and[Beat] gone?[6N]
What's the point[,] dammit?![AN]

[MR]
Because I promised to protect you[,][N]
little light.[AN][C]
I saw the Emperor's gaze[Beat] And[N]
I stood beneath the Apostle's cold hand.[6N]
The power they wield now[Beat][AN]
Your army holds no chance of victory[,][N]
no matter how united or powerful[N]
you all think you are.[AN]

[L]
Oh[,] so you want me to fight you[,] Lady Vida.[6N]
You want me to prove myself.[6N]
That's what this is about.[AN]

[MR]
You are the heir to a broken throne.[6N]
I cannot let you pass until you've shown[N]
me you can take it.[AN]
Not until you understand what weight[N]
you truly carry.[.6] I want you to win[,][N]
but know that I will never yield.[AN]

[L]
But[Beat] Why?[AN]

[MR]
If you can't face me[,] you've no hope[N]
of facing either the crown or the[N]
altar.[.6] This is the only way.[AN]

[L]
Then[Beat] [MoveLeft]Here I come[,] Lady Vida.[AN]

[MR]
Show me what you've become[,] little light.[.6][N]
Show me you've the strength to persist[N]
and survive this winter.[AN]

I'm proud of you[,] little light.[AN]

[ML]
You didn't raise your blade to kill[N]
me[,] Lady Vida.[.6] I saw you hesitate![AN]

[MR]
This is what it means to choose your[N]
own fate[,] little light.[.6] To do what you[n]
must to see things through.[AN]

[ML]
I[Beat] I thought I abandoned you[,] Lady Vida.[6N]
When the Consul took you down[,] I[Beat][N]
There was a spark of light.[AN]

[MR]
That was your powers awakening[,] little light.[6N]
A lucent fated to rule[,] what a scamp[N]
I've brought in[,] hahaha[Beat][AN]
We don't always get to return the way[N]
we left.[.6] You[,] too[,] have changed.[6N]
There's[Beat] a charge within you.[AN]

[ML]
I[Beat][AN]

[MR]
What a privilege to see you transform[N]
into the light of the empire[,] Chiffon.[6N]
You're hardly recognizable now.[AN]
Not the girl who couldn't bake bread[N]
to save her life[,] but the woman who's[N]
still standing now before me.[AN]

[L]
You did so much more for me than I could[N]
ever put into words[,] Lady Vida.[.6][N]
You stayed when nobody else would.[AN]
When you died[,] I thought I had nothing[N]
left.[.6] But you were always by my[N]
side[,] huh[Beat]?[.6] Walking with me.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat]Good[Beat][AN]

[L]
I[Beat] There's a path I must walk still.[6N]
Not just for the Order[,] the empire[,] but[N]
for the entirety of Ideon.[AN][C]
I know that I won't turn back now.[AN]

[MR]
Then I can go knowing that[Beat] You saw[N]
me again[Beat] little light[Beat][N]
And you've changed.[AN]
Don't close your eyes[Beat][N]

Take your time[,] Your Highness.[AN][CF]

[.6][.6][.4][MR][CF]

[MR][AffoSwitch]
You could've let somebody else finish[N]
the fight[,] Your Highness.[.6] Nobody[N]
would've questioned it.[AN]

[ML]
Even when I failed and I fell apart[,][N]
she always stayed by my side.[.6][N]
Through everything.[AN]
Even at the end, she chose to fight me[N]
just to keep me from walking into[N]
something I wasn't ready for.[AN]

[MR]
She waited for you.[.6] Maybe not the way she[N]
hoped to[,] but she held on until you[N]
got here.[AN]
And she died knowing you came back.[6N]
I'm sure that was the most she[N]
could ask for.[AN]

[ML]
Apsiel[,] you and her[Beat][N]
You're not like us anymore[,] are you?[AN]

[MR]
I never was like you[,] child of the[N]
Serpent[,] or anybody else.[.6] I was[N]
born chained to the Harbinger.[AN]
Lady Vida called it right.[.6] I fight[,] and[N]
move[,] and think.[.6] But I feel no[N]
cold.[.6] No charge.[AN][C]
I'm[Beat] a ghost in the wrong war[,][N]
Your Highness.[AN]

[ML]
You're being cryptic again.[AN]

[MR]
I fought in the old war with the empire[N]
as an Imperial spy.[.6] I died like a dog[N]
in the kingdom.[AN]
I understand now.[.6] I made a pact.[6N]
The Apostle's powers brought me from[N]
the brink of death.[AN]
But it was the Harbinger who gave me[N]
this form.[.6] He who laid dormant until[N]
the start of the war.[AN]
Those abandoned ruins I explored with the[N]
rest of the 7th Platoon[Beat] The Harbinger[N]
was hunting for a feast.[AN]
I am the Ashen Rider[,] the Harbinger who[N]
will bring balance to this world.[6N]
In that case[,] we're enemies.[AN]

[ML]
So the Primordial One resides within a[N]
vessel of a dead man[Beat] Now without[N]
pain or hunger.[AN]
Maybe that's what my sister fears.[.6][N]
A frozen heart[,] unable to be unmade[N]
or even fully control.[AN]

[MR]
Are you afraid?[.6] Your eyes are open.[AN]

[ML]
I think[Beat] I shed the last of my tears[,] Apsiel.[.6][N]
I'm not afraid anymore.[.6] I already grieved[N]
her death a long time ago.[AN]
But now[Beat] I know I must keep moving.[6N]
If we don't win this[,] it's all over.[AN]
Lady Vida's death will mean nothing.[AN]

[MR]
Then let's go.[.6] Let's[Beat] keep moving.[AN]
