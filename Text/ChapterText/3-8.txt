This place must be ancient[Beat] But it's[N]
familiar somehow.[.6]

I've never seen frost cling to stone[N]
like this.[.6] Something must be feeding[N]
this bloom from the inside.[AN]

So this[Beat] was my birthplace[,] huh?[.6] A short[N]
flicker of my life before they threw me out.[6N]
I wonder how it still stands.[AN]

It stands because no one has ever taken it;[.4][N]
not in[Beat] two centuries.[AN]

This is where the Consuls fled to.[6N]
The final line.[.6] Whatever the Emperor's[N]
planning[,] he's doing it from the top.[AN]

Then we'll climb and get 'em all out.[AN]

There's movement ahead[,] Your Highness.[.6][N]
Stay on guard.[AN]

[FFR]
I'm sorry it's come to this[,][N]
Your Highness.[AN]

No[Beat][AN]

[ML]

Lady Vida?![.6] How[Beat] No[,] you're not real![6N]
You're just another conjuration of[N]
the Apostle.[AN]

I am alive[,] little light.[.6] I never wanted[N]
us to meet again like this.[N]
But I knew[Beat][AN]
If anybody were to plough towards[N]
the Bastion[,] it'd be you.[6N]
It had to be you.[AN]

No[Beat] No, that's not possible.[6N]
I saw you die.[.6] I saw him kill you.[AN]

Chiffon[Beat] Please don't do this.[6N]
You've always closed your eyes[N]
when afraid.[.6] You still do.[AN]

You--[.4]You died[,] Lady Vida.[6N]
Your spirit and essence are with me[,][N]
within this etherium.[AN]
Consul Maynard killed you with a single[N]
flash of light.[.6] I still see it flicker[N]
every night.[AN]

The Consul spared me[,] took me back[N]
to the Bastion.[.6] The Apostle was mortified.[6N]
She healed me.[AN]
Do you understand?[.6] I[Beat] made a choice.[6N]
Not for myself[,] little light.[6N]
For you[,] and only you.[AN]

Your Highness[Beat] This is no phantasm.[6N]
I fear this is the truth.[AN]

Then[Beat] But![.6] I don't understand![6N]
Why the hell are you standing with[N]
the empire?![AN]
What kind of twisted deal did my[N]
sister force you to--[AN]

It was a difficult choice[,] but a[N]
necessary one.[.6] I underwent the same[N]
transformation as the man beside you.[AN]

[Beat][AN]

Apostle Sylveria's powers are beyond us now.[6N]
We are alive[,] yes[Beat] But we lack[N]
a crucial construct.[AN]

[Pause]And that is?[AN]

Soul.[.6] A reaper's carving.;[.4] alive[,] without[N]
the ties to humanity that we bore.[6N]
She reached beyond the shores of death.[AN]
We can't ever return fully from the[N]
Serpent's flame.[.6] That is a folly[N]
even the most mystic can't solve.[AN]

[Pause]Then[Beat] I really am[Beat][AN]

You feel it too[,] don't you?[6N]
That stillness under your skin.[.6][N]
That inability to ache[,] cry[,] scream.[AN]
In a way[,] we are no different than[N]
the rest of the Apostle's wraiths.[6N]
We feel echoes[,] not fullness.[AN]

Apsiel[Beat]?[AN]

That explains how you vanish with[N]
a casted shadow apropos of nothing.[6N]
That's why we couldn't sense you.[AN]
There was nothing to detect.[AN]

Then why are you here?[.6] Why even speak to me?[.6][N]
If you're hollow and[Beat] gone?[6N]
What's the point[,] dammit?![AN]

Because I promised you[,] little light.[AN][C]
I saw the Emperor's gaze[Beat][N]
I stood beneath the Apostle's cold hand.[6N]
The power they wield now[Beat][AN]
Your army holds no chance[,] no matter[N]
how united or powerful you all[N]
think you are.[AN]

You want me to fight you[,] Lady Vida.[6N]
You want me to prove myself.[6N]
That's what this is.[AN]

You are the heir to a broken throne.[6N]
I cannot let you pass until you've shown[N]
me your power.[AN]
Not until you understand what weight[N]
you truly carry.[.6] I want you to[N]
win[,] but know that I will not yield.[AN]

But[Beat] Why?[AN]

If you can't face me[,] you've no hope[N]
of defeating Selwyn or Sylveria.[6N]
This is the only way.[AN]

Then[Beat] Here I come[,] Lady Vida.[AN]

Show me what you've become[,][N]
little light.[.6] Show me you can[N]
survive this winter![AN]

[X]


## Part3Chapter8Ending1
# arent u forgeting someone
[3L]

So[Beat] It ends like this.[.6][N]
I'm proud of you[,] little light.[AN]

You didn't raise your blade to kill[N]
me[,] Lady Vida.[.6] I saw you hesitate![AN]

This is what it means to choose your[N]
own fate[,] Chiff.[.6] To do what you must[N]
to see things through.[AN]

I[Beat] I thought I abandoned you[,] Lady Vida.[6N]
When the Consul took you down[,] I[Beat][N]
There was a spark of light.[AN]

That was your powers awakening[,] little light.[6N]
A lucent fated to rule[,] what a scamp[N]
I've brought in[,] hahaha[Beat][AN]
We don't always get to return the way[N]
we left.[.6] You[,] too[,] have changed.[6N]
There's[Beat] a charge within you.[AN]

I[Beat][AN]

What a privilege to see you transform[N]
into the light of the empire[,] Chiffon.[6N]
You're hardly recognizable now.[AN]
Not the girl who couldn't bake bread[N]
to save her life[,] but the woman who's[N]
still standing now before me.[AN]

You did so much more for me than I could[N]
ever put into words[,] Lady Vida.[.6][N]
You stayed when nobody else would.[AN]
When you died[,] I thought I had nothing[N]
left.[.6] But you were always by my[N]
side[,] huh[Beat]?[.6] Walking with me.[AN]

[Beat]Good[Beat][AN]

I[Beat] There's a path I must walk still.[6N]
Not just for the Order[,] the empire[,] but[N]
for the entirety of Ideon.[AN][C]
I know that I won't turn back now.[AN]

Then I can go knowing that[Beat] You saw[N]
me again[Beat] little light[Beat][N]
And you've changed.[AN]
Don't close your eyes[Beat][N]
Don't be afraid[Beat] because I know[Beat][N]
Y[Beat] Y-[.4]You're ready[Beat][AN][.6][CF]

[OpenEyes]
[Mouth].........[Mouth][AN]


[Pause]We'll continue on ahead.[6N]
Take your time[,] Your Highness.[AN]

[Event]

You could've let somebody else finish[N]
the fight[,] Your Highness.[.6] Nobody[N]
would've questioned it.[AN]

Even when I failed and I fell apart[,][N]
she always stayed by my side.[.6][N]
Through everything.[AN]
Even at the end, she chose to fight me[N]
just to keep me from walking into[N]
something I wasn't ready for.[AN]

She waited for you.[.6] Maybe not the way she[N]
hoped to[,] but she held on until you[N]
got here.[AN]
And she died knowing you came back.[6N]
I'm sure that was the most she[N]
could ask for.[AN]

Apsiel[,] you and her[Beat][N]
You're not like us anymore[,] are you?[AN]

I never was like you[,] child of the[N]
Serpent[,] or anybody else.[.6] I was[N]
born one of the Harbinger.[AN]
Lady Vida called it right.[.6] I fight[,][N]
move[,] and think.[.6] But I feel no[N]
cold.[.6] No charge.[AN][C]
I'm[Beat] a ghost in the wrong war[,][N]
Your Highness.[AN]

You're being cryptic again.[AN]

I fought in the old war with the empire[N]
as an Imperial spy.[.6] I died like a dog[N]
in the kingdom.[AN]
I understand now.[.6] I made a pact.[6N]
The Apostle's powers brought me from[N]
the brink of death.[AN]
But it was the Harbinger who gave me[N]
this form.[.6] He laid dormant until[N]
the start of the war.[AN]
Those abandoned ruins I explored with the[N]
rest of the 7th Platoon[Beat] The Harbinger[N]
was feasting for power.[AN]
I am the Ashen Rider[,] the Harbinger who[N]
will bring balance to this world.[6N]
Is this[Beat] really me?[AN]

The Primordial One resides within a[N]
vessel of a dead man[Beat] Now without[N]
pain or hunger.[AN]
Maybe that's what my sister fears.[.6][N]
A frozen heart[,] unable to be unmade[N]
or even fully control.[AN]

Are you afraid?[.6] Your eyes are open.[AN]

I shed the last of my tears a long[N]
time ago[,] Apsiel.[.6] I'm not afraid anymore.[6N]
I already grieved a while ago.[AN]
But now[Beat] I know I must keep moving.[6N]
If we don't win this[,] it's all over.[AN]
Lady Vida's death will mean nothing.[AN]

Then let's go.[.6] Let's keep moving.[AN]

[X]
