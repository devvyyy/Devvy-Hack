[OpenRight][LoadChiffon]
[OpenFarRight][LoadGraham]

[OpenLeft]
Alright,[.4] we need a brief[N]
respite.[.6] We deserve it[Beat][AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Yeah![.6] I'm all tuckered[N]
out[Beat][AN]

[OpenLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadWilken]
Quiet down.[.6] You'll alert[N]
the guards[Beat][AN]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][Pause]And Frye out here being[N]
a living lantern won't?[AN]

[OpenLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadFrye]Woah,[.4] don't drag me[N]
into this again.[AN]
I assure you this sword is[N]
quite safeguarded.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadCortado]
God.[.6] Damn.[.6] Can you three[N]
please quiet down?[AN]
I can't believe we all got exiled and[N]
you're bantering like kids.[A][ClearFace]

[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadVerna]
Alright,[.4] so[Beat] What's[N]
our plan,[.4] Chiff?[AN]

[OpenRight]
We have to get out of Omios.[.6][N]
It's our biggest priority.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
Exactly what I'm thinking.[.6] If we can[N]
leave the crown city alive,[AN]
we can find a haven and form a[N]
resistance against the Trinity.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadWilken]
A resistance force[Beat][.6] Uh,[.4][N]
are you really sure about this?[AN]

[OpenLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadBard]
We can't just turn back and beg for mercy[N]
after what transpired.[AN]

[OpenRight]
I got us in this situation.[.6][N]
I messed up again[Beat][AN]
I shouldn't have lost[N]
my temper there[Beat][AN]

[OpenFarRight]
There's no turning back now.[.6][N]
Have faith in us,[.4] princess.[AN]
We need to focus on escaping[N]
the crown city.[AN]
I suggest we scout ahead and[N]
find the crown city gates.[AN]

[OpenLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadVerna]
Got it,[.4] boss.[AN][ClearFace]

[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadCortado]
There shouldn't be too many[N]
soldiers[Beat][AN][ClearFace]

[OpenRight][MoveMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadChiffon][OpenMidRight][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]

[OpenMidLeft]
Graham,[.4] where-[.4] and how are we even[N]
going to start a resistance?[AN]
Does that mean we have to turn our[N]
blades against Aeteria?[AN]
She's not heartless-[.4] I'm betting[N]
she'd listen to reason[Beat]![AN]
Maybe even Maynard would[N]
listen to us.[AN]
We just have to explain[N]
ourselves[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidRight]
You weren't explaining yourself, you[N]
denounced the values they lived by.[AN]
The Trinity doesn't change, Chiffon. They[N]
ride glory upon their past achievements.[AN]
You've known this forever-[.4] you must[N]
accept it,[.4] princess.[AN]
They will not listen to us: we must[N]
survive with our blades.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
But Graham,[.4] that brings up[N]
another question:[AN]
Who would trust me over the Aeterian[N]
army and the Trinity?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
You are the only one with the birthright[N]
to unite Aeteria,[.4] Your Highness.[AN]
The people will follow your[N]
every command.[AN]
Convince them your actions are just,[.4][N]
and they'll follow your lead.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
But what about our enemies?[.6] The[N]
Trinity[Beat] the royal guard[Beat][AN]
We'd be fighting against our[N]
friends and family.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
We must make use with what we have-[.4][N]
your royal blood.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
So[Beat] we're[Beat] renegades,[.4] now.[.6][N]
Defectors from the royal family.[AN]
Does that make them[N]
our enemy?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
We no longer have enemies,[.4] princess.[.6][N]
Just those destined to be cut down.[AN]
Come now,[.4] we must make haste and[N]
exit the crown city immediately.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
If we can sneak past the city[N]
and hurry onto Duskwave[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I know a forest village we can[N]
sail to.[AN]
It is our best chance at[N]
a refuge.[AN]

## Ch8Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVerna][OpenMidRight][LoadCortado]
[OpenMidRight]
[OpenQuote]Man,[.4] I love fishing and talking[N]
about the moon."[AN]
[Pause]That's my best impression of that guy.[.6][N]
Pretty good,[.4] right?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Please focus,[.4] Verna.[.6] [CloseEyes]I can't[N]
deal with this anymore.[AN][OpenEyes]

[OpenMidRight]
There's craters everywhere[Beat] Yup,[.4][N]
it's Omios,[.4] alright.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Mm,[.4] and today we're not[N]
fishing in them.[AN]
There's armed guards too,[.4][N]
as expected.[AN]

[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Whew,[.4] there's even[N]
ballistae.[AN]
By the Rider,[.4] this is going to be[N]
impossibly unfun.[AN]

their senses and admit their crimes?[AN]
Then we can drown ourselves in ale[N]
