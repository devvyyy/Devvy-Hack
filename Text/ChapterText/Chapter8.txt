We have to get out of Omios.[.6][N]
It's our biggest priority.[AN]

Exactly what I'm thinking.[.6] If we can[M]
leave the crown city alive,[AN]
we can find a haven and form a[N]
resistance against the Trinity.[AN]

A resistance force[Beat][.6][N]
Are you sure about this?[AN]

We cannot turn back and beg for forgiveness[N]
after what transpired.[AN]

I really messed everything up.[.6][N]
Again[Beat][AN]

There's no turning back now.[.6][N]
Have faith in me.[AN]

I mean,[.4] where-[.4] and how are we even[N]
going to start a resistance?[AN]
Who would trust me over the Aeterian[N]
army and the Trinity?[AN]

You are the only one with the birthright[N]
to unite Aeteria,[.4] Your Highness.[AN]
The people will follow your[N]
every command.[AN]
Convince them your actions are just,[.4][N]
and they'll follow your lead.[AN]

But what about our enemies?[.6] The[N]
Trinity[Beat] the royal guard[Beat][AN]

We no longer have enemies,[.4] princess.[.6][N]
Just those destined to be cut down.[AN]
Come now,[.4] we must make haste and[N]
exit the crown city immediately.[AN][X]

## Ch8Opening2
How can I atone when I put[N]
your life at risk[Beat]?[A][X]

We're[Beat] renegades,[.4] now.[.6] Defectors[N]
from the royal family.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
What are you fleeing?[.6][N]
[Pause]What have you done?[AN]

That was my best Graham impression.[.6][N]
Pretty good,[.4] right?[AN]

[X]


## Ch8Opening3
# maybe make the boss recruitable?
Is it really true?[.6] The princess[N]
of Aeteria[Beat] a traitor?[AN]

Yes,[.4] word goes that she defied[N]
the Trinity-[.4] and her mother.[AN]

General Aoife will be[N]
arriving soon.[AN]
Ready your positions![.6] We must[N]
not let the turncoats pass![AN]
