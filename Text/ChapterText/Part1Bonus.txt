Uh[,] I'll be blunt and quick to the point:[.4] I[N]

That's troublesome.[.6] If you mind[,] have you[N]

recent development?[AN]

[MR]
It's always been on the back of my mind.[6N]
My parents wanted me to pick up a pen.[6N]
It was only recently that I could enlist.[AN]
They told me[,] [OpenQuote]As a noble of House Reinier[,][N]
you must never pick up a blade.[.6] The[N]

Ah[,] you're Reinier's kid![.6] I trained[N]
your brother[,] you know.[.6] His squire days[N]

Your father's words are[Beat] surprising.[6N]
With your family's track record[,] I'd say you[N]
have nothing to fear[,] Reinier.[AN]

[MR]
That's exactly why I fear I can't keep up.[.6][N]
I joined the royal guard so incredibly[N]
late compared to the rest.[AN][Clear]
I wanted to enlist so much earlier[,][N]

How much more progress could I have made[Beat]?[AN]

That's alright.[.6] Your strength and loyalty[N]

You have a lot of time.[.6] Take life slow[N]

[OpenMidRight]
Alright,[.4] everybody is in[N]
position,[.4] then?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
I'm not sure.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
In a moment, the Aeterian forces[N]
will begin charging through the[N]
walls of the castle.[AN][Clear]
They aim to destroy everything[N]
in Castle Wreyvine.[AN][Clear]
They aim to burn the entire kingdom[N]
down for their late empress.[AN][Clear]
Don't let them enter the citadel.[.6][N]
Don't let them destroy our supplies.[AN][Clear]
We cannot put the King's life in danger,[.4][N]
no matter the cost.[.6][n]
You hear me?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
So we defend the castle gates,[.4] supplies,[.4][N]
and try not to lose our lives.[AN][Clear]
With our numbers,[.4] some would say we[N]
should sign our death warrants now.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
It's now or never,[.4] Affogato.[.6][N]
Ideally,[.4] we'd have more soldiers.[.6][N]
We'd have an entire army with us.[AN]
Ideally, we'd have better equipment.[6N]
We'd have more time.[.6] We wouldn't[N]
be in this mess in the first place.[AN][Clear]
Look at everybody around you.[6N]
We're all wary,[.4] but ready.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
I can hardly count their numbers.[.6] Yet[N]
we seem to have a few dozen.[.6N]
I'm not sure if this is possible.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Our healers are all busy tending to[N]
the wounded in the infirmary.[AClear]
Our scouts and fliers are trying to[N]
find potential escape routes.[AN]
If you want to desert so badly[,] now'd be[N]
the perfect time to join them.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
No[,] never.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleSmile]As I expected.[ToggleSmile][.6] It's now or never.[.6N]
The rest of the Holy Guard are inside[,][N]
in case the worst comes to light.[AN]
We have the King's Battalion fighting[N]
with us,[.4] but it's just the three.[6N]
We'll get a few more soldiers with us[N]
later[,] but that's not enough.[6N]
A few versus hundreds.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Alright.[.6] We won't die here.[.6][N]
I'll make sure of it.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Good.[.6] This will be the decisive battle.[.6][N]
If they break through,[.4] all of[N]
us will lose our lives.[AN]
Their onslaught is starting now.[.6][N]
Fight like your life depends on it[Beat][N]
[Pause]Because it does![AN]

[MR]
Please take this seriously[,] Lennard.[.6N]
Everybody else is fighting their[N]
hardest out here.[AN]

[ML]
Word[,] Therese.[.6] I'll try my[,] er[,][N]
hardest out here.[AN]

[MR]
We weren't supposed to be so late.[N]
If only if you weren't too busy[N]
grabbing lunch[Beat][AN]

Hey[,] we can make up for it now![6N]
Come on[,] Therese[,] let's go![AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Very impressive performance for such a[N]
feeble country.[.6] They can put up quite[N]
a fair fight for us.[AN][Clear]
Unfortunately,[.4] steel is nothing[N]
compared to magic.[.6] Onwards![AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Selwyn.[.6] My gift[Beat] Must I finally[N]
release them here[Beat]?[.6] I'm fully[N]
prepared to channel,[AN]
if the situation demands it[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Nay,[.4] hold off for now.[.6] Gifted[N]
magic such as yours is to be saved[N]
for the perfect opportunity.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Beneath the mask of silence,[.4] I hear[N]
you:[.4] I know you desire retribution as[N]
much as I.[AN][Clear]
Just know that[Beat] We are in this[N]
together,[.4] Sylvie.[.6] Hold off.[AN]

Aeterian army[,] don't falter now.[6n]
You have done well so far[,] and this[N]
is the final push before they break.[AN][Clear]
We take the castle now and our efforts[N]
will bear fruit.[.6] Show them Aeterian fealty.[AN]

# Ogrim.[.6] How many soldiers[N]are you tending to?[AN]I've never seen anything like[N]this before.[AN]The number of the wounded[N]is overwhelming.[AN]
[3l]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTammy][OpenMidRight][LoadOgrim]

[OpenMidLeft]
Sir Ogrim.[.6] This is the most amount of[N]
wounded I've seen in the infirmary.[N]
It's haunting[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Listen[,] lass.[.6] This is all we can do.[6N]
The King's Battalion are fighting their[N]
hearts out at the front.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
We are running low on medical supplies[,] sir.[6N]
Our clerics and priests cannot make[N]
up for that.[AN][Clear]
Have we received any orders[,] sir?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
No[,] lass.[.6] I fear we must continue to heal[N]
and escape if the Pale Citadel were to fall.[6N]
*sigh* Oh[,] by the Iron Tusks[Beat][AN][Clear]
I pray we can reunite alive[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadKing][MR][LoadGorlois][FFR][LoadIris]

[MR]
This is dire[,] is it not?[.6] Must we not[N]
act as an unofficial war council?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Divine Iris[,] the council requires your[N]
clairvoyance yet again.[AN][ML][MoveFarLeft][MR][ClearFace][L][LoadGorlois]

[FFR][MoveMidRight]
[MR]
Your Majesty.[.6] What do you require[N]
of my duties?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Could you see any escape routes that our[N]
scouts did not?[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]All of the gates are overrun by Aeterian[N]
soldiers.[.6] I fear our only choice is to exit[N]
the castle and charge through.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Charge through?![.6] Where on the hallowed[N]
lands of Ideon could we possibly be[N]
charging through?[AN]

[FL]
Northelm is home to many strongholds.[6N]
Any one of them shall suffice for[N]
the future of Wreyvine.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
The future of Wreyvine?[.6] The now[N]
is death and war![.6] Your Majesty[,][N]
we must relocate to a safer position.[AN]
It's best to keep our lives if we can[,][N]
considering the situation[Beat][6N]
[CloseEyes]What are we to do[Beat]?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
[CloseEyes]Gorlois[,] I can see[Beat] the fighting[Beat][N]
Wreyvine is neither losing[,][N]
nor winning[Beat][AN][Clear]
I trust in the Hearthbringer to bring[N]
them back well and safely.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
I'm telling you[,] Your Majesty.[.6] I[N]
must go to the front lines and fight[N]
with the others.[AN][Clear]
Lest the Pale Citadel falls to[N]
the enemy at hand![AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
I will not allow it.[.6] You are my[N]
second-in-command--my right-hand.[.4][N]
if you were to fall,[AN][Clear]
it would be ruinous for the holy guard.[6N]
Nay[,] for the entire kingdom.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
I have spent my entire life following orders[,][N]
Your Majesty.[.6] Yet it is now that you[N]
stay my hand?[AN][Clear]
We of the holy guard judge only[N]
on divine providence.[AN]

[FL]
It would be far too reckless to allow[N]
the Aeterian army to know that you are[N]
out there[,] and I am undefended.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
[CloseEyes]If you insist[,] then[Beat][AN]

This is an unreasonable amount of soldiers.[6N]
We're being pushed back.[.6] Sir[,] shall we[N]

No.[.6] This is fine.[.6] Move onwards[,] if you can![6N]

[OpenMidRight]
They've all fallen[Beat] [MoveMidRight]They were all shot[N]
down one-by-one![.6] There's many soldiers[N]
beyond the initial premises[Beat][AN][Clear]
Many of them look of high rank--[.4]t-[.4]there[N]
isn't much time![AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
By the Iron Tusks[Beat] Xavier[,] will you[N]
help defend those remaining with us?[AN]

[MR]
Yes[,] General.[.6] I'll do a lot more than[N]
that.[.6] I'm ready to fight all-out.[6N][MoveMidRight]
