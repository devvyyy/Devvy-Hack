Oh[,] I must jot that one down.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]General[,] please.[AN]

[ML]
Ah[,] my apologies.[.6] Go on[,] if you will.[AN]

[MR]
Uh[,] I'll be blunt and quick to the point:[.4] I[N]
feel as though I cannot keep up with my[N]
fellow knights.[AN]

[ML]
That's troublesome.[.6] If you mind[,] have you[N]
always felt this way[,] or is this a rather[N]
recent development?[AN]

[MR]
It's always been on the back of my mind.[6N]
My parents wanted me to pick up a pen.[6N]
It was only recently that I could enlist.[AN]
Being born the youngest daughter of a[N]
prominent house[,] I've always had[N]
high standards for myself.[AN]
They told me[,] [OpenQuote]As a noble of House Reinier[,][N]
you must never pick up a blade.[.6] The[N]
battlefield is far too perilous."[AN]

[ML]
Ah[,] you're Reinier's kid![.6] I trained[N]
your brother[,] you know.[.6] His squire days[N]
had him as proud as you now.[AN]
Your father's words are[Beat] surprising.[6N]
With your family's track record[,] I'd say you[N]
have nothing to fear[,] Reinier.[AN]

[MR]
That's precisely why I fear[,] General.[.6][N]
I joined the royal guard so incredibly[N]
late compared to the rest.[AN]
Knighthood was always my dream[,][N]
and I trained long[,] vicious hours to[N]
achieve it.[AN]
I wanted to enlist so much earlier[,] but[N]
I was held back.[.6] It's embarrassing.[6N]
How much more progress could I have made[Beat]?[AN]

[ML]
That's alright.[.6] Your strength and loyalty[N]
more than make up for that lost time.[AN]

[MR]
You really think so?[.6] I guess I must just[N]
continue to work harder than my peers.[AN]

[ML]
Hey[,] take it from me.[.6] I didn't join[N]
the royal guard until I was twenty.[6N]
I wasn't wed until I was thirty-three![AN]
You have a lot of time.[.6] Take life slow[N]
