Nothing.[.6] It looks like we're the only ones here.[N]
No Aeterian soldiers[,] as strange as that sounds.[AN]

[Beat]It's oddly quiet[,] huh? Are we being trailed[N]
by Aeteria?[.6] Their main forces were en route.[AN]

[FL]
No[,] definitely not.[.6] This is the deepest part[N]
of Wreyvine.[.6] We would've noticed if we were[N]
being followed by anyone.[AN]

[R]
How uncanny.[.6] The Aeterian forces were last seen[N]
at the front of the capital city.[.6] Considering[N]
we had to take a detour[,][AN]
their steady march should have led them[N]

Knights of the 7th Platoon. Knights of the royal guard. You all understand why you're here. Our twin country has accused us of assassinating their Empress. I truly appreciate your work in fulfilling previous orders. But I am afraid the time for a pivotal battle comes upon us[,] unprepared as we are.

[FR]
Your Majesty[Beat] If I may[,] I fear we must try more[Beat] drastic measures.

[ML][LoadUlrich]
This is the same strategy Aeteria used[N]
twenty years ago[Beat][AN][ClearFace]

[ML][LoadKlavdia]
We'll get overrun if we don't charge them head on.[6N]
If we want to push them back and cull their[N]
numbers[,] that must be our strategy.[AN][ClearFace]

[ML][LoadGerolf]
A defensive strategy would be our only choice here[N]
if we want to prevent the Aeterians from moving[N]
towards us.[.6] Traps[,] blockades[,] what else[Beat]?[AN][ClearFace]

[ML][LoadWegman]
Traps?![.6] General[,] where is your sense of honor?![AN][ClearFace]

Don't give me that 'honor' crap.[.6] If Castle[N]
