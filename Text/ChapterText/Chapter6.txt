[OpenMidRight]Your Majesty,[.4] pardon me-[.4] I should[N]
be focusing on the battle,[.4] but[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You should,[.4] yes.[.6][N]
But ask away,[.4] hunter.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I was wondering if you knew[N]
why we were fighting.[AN]
What their goals are,[.4][N]
and all that.[AN]
When I was with Ulrich's squadron[N]
at the ruins,[AN]
It was our first encounter[N]
with the Aeterians.[AN]
I'm not from either land,[.4] I[N]
don't think.[AN]
I don't really know this[N]
place's history.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]This isn't a good time for[N]
a history lesson.[AN]
We've been at relative peace for decades,[.4][N]
Wreyvine and Aeteria.[AN]
We weren't expecting an attack,[.4][N]
but it wasn't exactly unexpected.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You have a good memory,[.4][N]
Your Majesty.[AN]
To remember something so long[N]
ago[Beat] I'm envious.[AN]
Even I don't remember my life clearly[N]
before I joined the knights.[AN]
I hunted,[.4] but what in[N]
the world did I hunt?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Affogato,[.4] I'm certain you'll[N]
remember in time.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]Unfortunate.[.6] But there's nothing[N]
