[OpenMidLeft]Heya,[.4] Captain Brudet![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Did you need something?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Isn't it so scary,[.4] having to[N]
protect the King like this?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
It's nothing we haven't[N]
done before.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's nothing you've[N]
done before.[AN]
I'm a city guard![.6] I didn't realize[N]
we'd do something this grand.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Life is full of surprises;[.4][N]
I'd know.[AN]
I'm not even from Ideon and I[N]
get promoted to a royal captain.[AN]
All because of my axe[N]

[OpenMidLeft]
That's incredible,[.4][N]
Captain![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Is that all you wanted[N]

[OpenMidRight]No way![.6] [ToggleSmile]You seem like the[N]
fastest and strongest around.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Where did you learn[N]
to use that sword?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]My father was a swordmaster[N]
in a distant land.[AN]
My mother was a master of[N]
manipulating flames.[AN]
They taught my brother and I everything[N]
we know about swords and spells.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I see[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidLeft]So what about you?[.6] Who[N]
taught you how to fight?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]They're just standard medical[N]

Staves,[.4] vulneraries,[.4] holy waters,[N]
that sort of deal.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Aren't they heavy?[.6] Can't imagine[N]
carrying so many vulneraries.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You don't really think these[N]

## KingAffoTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKing][OpenMidRight][LoadAffoSwitch]
[OpenMidRight]Your Majesty,[.4] pardon me-[.4] I should[N]
be focusing on the battle,[.4] but[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You should,[.4] yes.[.6][N]
But ask away,[.4] hunter.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I was wondering if you knew[N]
why we were fighting.[AN]
What their goals are,[.4][N]
and all that.[AN]
When I was with Ulrich's squadron[N]
at the ruins,[AN]
It was our first encounter[N]
with the Aeterians.[AN]
I'm not from either land,[.4] I[N]
don't think.[AN]
I don't really know this[N]
place's history.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]This isn't a good time for[N]
a history lesson.[AN]
We've been at relative peace for decades,[.4][N]
Wreyvine and Aeteria.[AN]
We weren't expecting an attack,[.4][N]
but it wasn't exactly unexpected.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You have a good memory,[.4][N]
Your Majesty.[AN]
To remember something so long[N]
ago[Beat] I'm envious.[AN]
Even I don't remember my life clearly[N]
before I joined the knights.[AN]
I hunted,[.4] but what in[N]
the world did I hunt?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Affogato,[.4] I'm certain you'll[N]
remember in time.[AN]
Now,[.4] we have to[N]

[OpenMidRight]We couldn't save all of the[N]

[OpenMidLeft]Unfortunate.[.6] But there's nothing[N]
