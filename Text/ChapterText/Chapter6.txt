[OpenFarFarLeft]Are you still standing[N]

[MoveFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]You have been standing here[N]

Your Majesty[Beat] Perhaps[N]

[OpenMidRight]No.[AN]
[MidLeft]Your Majesty![.6] [MoveMidLeft]What if the situation[N]
halts their arrival?[AN]
[MidRight]Then I will stand here[N]
until they arrive.[AN]
[MidLeft]Are you serious?[.6] Your armor[N]
is starting to look like[AN]
the castle roof.[.6] It wouldn't[N]
be good if the King froze to death.[AN]
[MidRight]Cold does not bother me.[.6][N]
It never has.[AN]
I do not mind the[N]
elements.[AN]
[MidLeft]What's so important,[.4][N]

## Ch6Ending1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadGorlois][OpenLeft][LoadKing]
The palace is safe.[.6] I commend you[N]
all for your valiant efforts today.[AN]
[OpenRight][LoadAtheya][OpenFarRight][LoadUlrich]
I foresaw this attack today,[.4][N]
yet I was too late.[AN]
My sincere apologies for forcing[N]
you all here in a hurry.[AN]

[OpenRight]Your Majesty,[.4] the pleasure[N]
is ours.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]You[Beat] foresaw this[N]
attack?[AN][Event]

[OpenFarLeft]Correct.[.6] Those marked by Wreyvine's[N]
Hallowed King are gifted with prescience.[AN]
The mark is passed down through[N]
generations and upon death.[AN]
[OpenLeft]It's[Beat] hrm,[.4] not the most[N]
reliable.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]So the Keepers[Beat] they knew[N]
of such a power?[AN]

[OpenLeft]It makes sense that they[N]
would come here for the Eye.[AN]
Yet[Beat] Truth be told:[.6][N]
I do not have it.[AN]
I cannot even use the tome,[.4] for I[N]
know nothing of magic and ether.[AN]
We are linked,[.4] indeed,[.4] but the tome[N]
has been lost for generations.[AN]

[OpenRight]Seriously[Beat]?[.6] Kind of a dangerous[N]
thing to be lying around somewhere.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]Only those blessed by the Hallowed King[N]
can wield the Eye.[AN]
They are no threat to us[N]
without the blessing.[AN]
But if worst comes to worst,[.4][N]
it would be wise to take care[AN]
of this situation quickly,[.4][N]
while we have the chance.[AN]

[OpenLeft]I have a request for you knights:[.6][N]
Recover[.5] the Eye of the King.[AN]
Bring our rightful light back[N]
into Wreyvine's crown.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]We will see to that,[.4][N]
Your Majesty.[AN]

[OpenLeft]That is all.[.6][N]
Thank you.[A]

[OpenRight][LoadUlrich][OpenFarRight][LoadAffogato]
I foresaw this attack today,[.4][N]
yet not without casualty.[AN]
The error is mine; I should[N]
have sent the warning earlier.[AN]
My sincere apologies for forcing[N]
you all here in a hurry.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]Your Majesty,[.4] I[Beat][AN]

[OpenRight]Halt.[.6] You foresaw this[N]
attack?[AN][Event]

[OpenFarLeft]Correct.[.6] Those marked by Wreyvine's[N]

[OpenRight]No way.[.6] No one bothered[N]
to recover something so perilous?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]Indeed.[.6] Yet only those blessed by[N]
the Hallowed King can wield the Eye.[AN]
They are no threat to us[N]
