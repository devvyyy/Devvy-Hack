[OpenRight]Your Majesty,[.4] the pleasure[N]

[OpenFarRight]You[Beat] foresaw this[N]

[OpenFarLeft]Correct.[.6] Those marked by Wreyvine's[N]
Hallowed King are gifted with prescience.[AN]
The mark is passed down through[N]
generations and upon death.[AN]
[OpenLeft]It's[Beat] hrm,[.4] not the most[N]

[OpenFarRight]So the Keepers[Beat] they knew[N]
of such a power?[AN]

[OpenLeft]It makes sense that they[N]
would come here for the Eye.[AN]
Yet[Beat] Truth be told:[.6][N]
I do not have it.[AN]
I cannot even use the tome,[.4] for I[N]
know nothing of magic and ether.[AN]
We are linked,[.4] indeed,[.4] but the tome[N]
has been lost for generations.[AN]

[OpenRight]Seriously[Beat]?[.6] Kind of a dangerous[N]
thing to be lying around somewhere.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]Only those blessed by the Hallowed King[N]
can wield the Eye.[AN]
They are no threat to us[N]
without the blessing.[AN]
But if worst comes to worst,[.4][N]
it would be wise to take care[AN]
of this situation quickly,[.4][N]
while we have the chance.[AN]

[OpenLeft]I have a request for you knights:[.6][N]
Recover[.5] the Eye of the King.[AN]
Bring our rightful light back[N]
into Wreyvine's crown.[AN]

[OpenFarRight][MoveRight]We will see to that,[.4][N]
