Where did you learn[N]

[OpenMidLeft]My father was a swordmaster[N]

My mother was a master of[N]
manipulating flames.[AN]
They taught my brother and I everything[N]

[OpenMidRight]Your Majesty,[.4] pardon me-[.4] I should[N]

[OpenMidLeft]You should,[.4] yes.[.6][N]
But ask away,[.4] hunter.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I was wondering if you knew[N]
why we were fighting.[AN]
What their goals are,[.4][N]
and all that.[AN]
When I was with Ulrich's squadron[N]
at the ruins,[AN]
It was our first encounter[N]
with the Aeterians.[AN]
I'm not from either land,[.4] I[N]
don't think.[AN]
I don't really know this[N]
