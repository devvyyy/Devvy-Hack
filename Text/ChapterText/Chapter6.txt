[Beat][N]
Hrm.[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadGorlois]
[OpenFarFarLeft]Are you still standing[N]
there,[.4] Your Majesty?[AN]
[MoveFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]You have been standing here[N]
like a statue for hours,[AN]
Your Majesty[Beat] Perhaps[N]
a pause will do?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No.[AN]
[MidLeft]Your Majesty![.6] [MoveMidLeft]What if the situation[N]
halts their arrival?[AN]
[MidRight]Then I will stand here[N]
until they arrive.[AN]
[MidLeft]Are you serious?[.6] Your armor[N]
is starting to look like[AN]
the castle roof.[.6] It wouldn't[N]
be good if the King froze to death.[AN]
[MidRight]Cold does not bother me.[.6][N]
It never has.[AN]
I do not mind the[N]
elements.[AN]
[MidLeft]What's so important,[.4][N]
anyways?[AN]
[MidRight]The Eye.[.6] It's a herald.[.6][N]
There will be a disturbance.[AN]

[OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight]
Keepers are invading the[N]
palace.[AN]
They seem to be led by[N]
an unknown leader.[AN]
We're completely[N]
overwhelmed![AN]
[OpenLeft]We go,[.4] Gorlois.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]I've never been readier,[.4][N]
Your Majesty![A][X]

## Ch6Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTherese][OpenMidRight][LoadLennard]
[OpenMidRight]Nobody ever told me we[N]
were going to fight shamans![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Do your job,[.4] Lennard.[.6][N]
Stab them.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]If only if it was[N]
that easy.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Quit your yammering.[N]
Follow me,[.4] we run them down.[A][X]

## Ch6Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffo]This is worse than[N]
I thought[Beat][AN]
[MoveMidRight]
Everyone,[.4] there's a battle[N]
inside the palace![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadStroganoff][OpenLeft][LoadFloris]
Well?[.6] What in the world are[N]
ya waitin' for?[AN]
Protect the King![.6] [MoveFarLeft]Get out[N]
of my way![AN][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace][X]

## Ch6OpeningAlt3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffo]This is worse than[N]
I thought[Beat][AN]
[MoveMidRight]
Everyone,[.4] there's a battle[N]
inside the palace![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadUlrich]It seems my worst fears[N]
are coming true.[AN]
Even so,[.4] we have to do[N]
what we can![AN]
Let's go,[.4] [MoveFarLeft]everyone.[.6][AN]
Defend the palace![A][X]

## Ch6Opening3Point5
[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich][OpenMidRight][LoadAtheya]
[OpenMidRight]There he goes[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]I don't have a good[N]
feeling about this[Beat][A][X]

## Ch6Warning1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffogato]
[OpenMidLeft]Something terrible is coming[N]
from the [ToggleRed]fortresses[ToggleRed] and [ToggleRed]waters[ToggleRed][Beat][AN]
Everyone,[.4][MoveMidLeft] brace yourselves![A][X]

## Ch6WTFMoment
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffogato]
[OpenMidLeft]What[Beat] are those[Beat]?[.6][N]
[CloseEyes]They look like shadows[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]
I don't know what they're[N]
sending at us,[AN]
but we'll get through[N]
this,[.4] no problem.[AN]
Stay on your guard,[.4][N]
everyone![A][X]

## Ch6Ending1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadGorlois][OpenLeft][LoadKing]
The palace is safe.[.6] I commend you[N]
all for your valiant efforts today.[AN]
[OpenRight][LoadAtheya][OpenFarRight][LoadUlrich]
I foresaw this attack today,[.4][N]
yet I was too late.[AN]
My sincere apologies for forcing[N]
you all here in a hurry.[AN]

[OpenRight]Your Majesty,[.4] the pleasure[N]
is ours.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]You[Beat] foresaw this[N]
attack?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]Correct.[.6] Those marked by Wreyvine's[N]
Hallowed King obtain prescience.[AN]
The mark is passed down through[N]
generations and upon death.[AN]
It's[Beat] hrm,[.4] not the most[N]
reliable.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]So the Keepers[Beat] they knew[N]
of such a power?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]It makes sense that they[N]
would come here for the Eye.[AN]
Yet[Beat] Truth be told:[.6][N]
I do not have it.[AN]
I cannot even use the tome,[.4] for I[N]
know nothing of magic and ether.[AN]
We are linked,[.4] indeed,[.4] but the tome[N]
has been lost for generations.[AN]

[OpenRight]Seriously[Beat]?[.6] Kind of a dangerous[N]
thing to be lying around somewhere.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]Only those blessed by the Hallowed King[N]
can wield the Eye.[AN]
They are no threat to us[N]
without the blessing.[AN]
But if worst comes to worst,[.4][N]
it would be wise to take care[AN]
of this situation quickly,[.4][N]
while we have the chance.[AN]

[OpenLeft]I have a request for you knights:[.6][N]
Recover[.5] the Eye of the King.[AN]
Bring our rightful light back[N]
into Wreyvine's crown.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]We will see to that,[.4][N]
Your Majesty.[AN]

[OpenLeft]That is all.[.6][N]
Thank you.[A]

[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidRight][LoadGorlois]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadGorlois][OpenLeft][LoadKing]
The palace is safe.[.6] I commend you[N]
all for your valiant efforts today.[AN]
[OpenRight][LoadUlrich][OpenFarRight][LoadAffogato]
I foresaw this attack today,[.4][N]
yet not without casualty.[AN]
The error is mine; I should[N]
have sent the warning earlier.[AN]
My sincere apologies for forcing[N]
you all here in a hurry.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]Your Majesty,[.4] I[Beat][AN]

[OpenRight]Halt.[.6] You foresaw this[N]
attack?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]Correct.[.6] Those marked by Wreyvine's[N]

We are linked,[.4] indeed,[.4] but the tome[N]
has been lost for generations.[AN]

[OpenRight]No way.[.6] No one bothered[N]
to recover something so perilous?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]Indeed.[.6] Yet only those blessed by[N]
the Hallowed King can wield the Eye.[AN]
They are no threat to us[N]
without the blessing.[AN]
But if worst comes to worst,[.4][N]
it would be wise to take care[AN]

[OpenMidRight]So,[.4] our next task is to find the[N]
Eye of the King?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes,[.4] but we won't be the[N]
only ones trying to find it.[AN]
No doubt the Keepers will try[N]
to stop us.[AN]
Now come,[.4] we must join the[N]
