Where did you learn[N]
to use that sword?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]My mother was a swordmaster[N]
in a distant land.[AN]
She taught my brother and I[N]
everything we knew.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I see[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidLeft]So what about you?[.6] Who[N]
taught you how to fight?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][Pause]Wow,[.4] would you look at that![.6][N]
Shamans over there![.6] Bye![AN][MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace]

[OpenMidLeft]What is in that satchel[N]
of yours,[.4] Floris?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]All the clacking while you go around[N]
is driving me crazy.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]They're just standard medical[N]
supplies.[AN]
Staves,[.4] vulneraries,[.4] holy waters,[N]
that sort of deal.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Aren't they heavy?[.6] Can't imagine[N]
carrying so many vulneraries.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You don't really think these[N]
are too heavy,[.4] do you?[AN]
After everything,[.4] this is[N]
the least of our worries.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Good point,[.4] I suppose.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight]Your Majesty,[.4] pardon me-[.4] I should[N]
be focusing on the battle,[.4] but[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You should,[.4] yes.[.6][N]
But ask away,[.4] hunter.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I was wondering if you knew[N]
why we were fighting.[AN]
What their goals are,[.4][N]
and all that.[AN]
When I was with Ulrich's squadron[N]
at the ruins,[AN]
It was our first encounter[N]
with the Aeterians.[AN]
I'm not from either land,[.4] I[N]
don't think.[AN]
I don't really know this[N]
place's history.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]This isn't a good time for[N]
a history lesson.[AN]
We've been at relative peace for decades,[.4][N]
Wreyvine and Aeteria.[AN]
We weren't expecting an attack,[.4][N]
but it wasn't exactly unexpected.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You have a good memory,[.4][N]
Your Majesty.[AN]
To remember something so long[N]
ago[Beat] I'm envious.[AN]
Even I don't remember my life clearly[N]
before I joined the knights.[AN]
I hunted,[.4] but what in[N]
the world did I hunt?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Affogato,[.4] I'm certain you'll[N]
remember in time.[AN]
Now,[.4] we have to[N]
persevere.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you,[.4][N]
Your Majesty.[AN]

inside my bag?)[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft]You look like you want to[N]
say something.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You read my mind,[.4][N]
Your Majesty.[AN]
I can't seem to get my mind[N]
off of yesterday's events.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Continue.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We couldn't save all of the[N]
villages yesterday.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Unfortunate.[.6] But there's nothing[N]
that can be done now.[AN]
What's done is done,[.4][N]
Affogato.[AN]
There's little room for mistakes[N]
from now on.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][Pause]Noted.[A]
