That was a close call.[.6] I'm glad we got out of[N]

Heh[,] didn't even break a sweat.[.6] We just[N]
haveta keep on moving.[AN]

[FR]
Look over there.[.6] That's a lot of soldiers.[AN]

[R]
Yeah.[.6] Outside the capital city is a military[N]
encampment.[.6] We'll have to fight our way[N]
out of this one[,] to boot.[AN]

[FL]
The camp must contain equipment.[.6] If[N]
we can get ahold of it[,] I advise taking[N]
what we can and scorching the rest.[AN]

[R]
Burning isn't necessary.[.6] What[,] do[N]
you think us the barbarians of[N]
the North[,] Graham?[AN]

[FL]
Any advantage for us is a disadvantage for[N]
the empire.[.6] Surely they handle useful[N]
equipment within the tents.[AN]

[R]
Not when we're trying to curry favor with[N]
Imperial generals[Beat] And I thought you[N]
were one for statecraft[,] Reverend.[AN][C]
What would the Aeterian people think of us[N]
if we razed their army's food and medicine?[AN]

[FL]
Either way[,] it is our leader's choice.[6N]

Pfah[,] please[Beat] There's no way a squad[N]

They've broken past the capital city.[6N]

Afraid?[.6] Turn that fear into preparation[,][N]

You got something personal with 'em[,] Sir?[AN]

With the assistance of that mercenary[,][N]

statue has[Beat] friends.[AN]

[MR]
[OpenQuote]Friends"[,] yes[,] I suppose so.[6N]
The Reverend used to almost regard[N]
that word with vitriol.[AN]
The three of us founded the Order[,][N]
yet I feel as though I never truly[N]
understood them.[AN]

[ML]
Three?[.6] Oh[,] right[,] you told me it was with[N]
that Toni guy.[.6] The pompous statesman[,] yeah?[AN]

[MR]
The Reverend used to call Antonius his[N]
[OpenQuote]better half"[.4]--as a jest[,] of course.[.6][N]
They were closer than brothers.[AN]
Antonius made the speeches and mentored[N]
while Graham did the dirty work.[.6][N]
We were the Order's cornerstones.[AN]
Three voices with one vision.[.6] We were[N]
the serpent beneath the Empire[,] waiting[N]
to strike.[.6] Reverend[,] Minister[,] Governor.[AN]
It is difficult to explain[,] Captain.[6N]
They simply understood each other in ways[N]
I never quite could.[AN]

[ML]
Tsch[,] your Order's got some real scars[,] Minister.[6N]
Hell[,] I knew even heard a word of this[N]
from Graham.[.6] Must be a sore wound.[AN]

[MR]
It is why we continue to fight.[6N]
This vision of peace and unity--[.4][N]
our new age of Aeteria will be realized.[AN]

[ML]
Ah[Beat] Snow's awful shiny[N]
today[,] eh Reverend?[.6] White[N]
as far as the eye can see.[AN]

[MR]
Gus.[.6] Calm your nerves.[AN]

[ML]
Ah[,] hell.[.6] How'd you know?[AN]

[MR]
I would say [OpenQuote]intuition"[,] but given[N]
who's on the battlefield today,[4N]
it was rather obvious.[AN]
I know I've said this to you[N]
time and time again[,] Gus,[4N]
but please don't blame yourself.[AN]
It may have been your idea to[N]
get Councilman Anton involved,[4N]
but it was an idea I signed off on.[AN]

[ML]
With the vast resources he had,[4N]
undermining the Emperor would've[N]
been a complete cakewalk[Beat][AN][C]
It was a risk[,] but it would've borne[N]
such ripe fruits[Beat][AN]

[MR]
There is no shame in reaching for[N]
an opportunity that seems right.[6N]
It was a collective blunder[,] Gus.[AN][C]
My approval on the matter was a[N]
mistake as severe as yours.[AN]

[ML]
[Beat]Yeah.[.6] And I'd say after today,[4N]
there's no reason to linger on the[N]
thought any longer.[AN]
It was me who first swept Anton[N]
into the Order's schemes[Beat][N]
so that's my bad.[AN]
Spilling his blood today won't fix[N]
that[Beat] But hell if it won't feel[N]
damn good when I do it.[AN]

[MR]
You are free to do what you like.[6N]
But do not lose sight of the[N]
horizon on the way[,] Gus.[AN]

[ML]
Don't worry.[.6] I've no intention to.[AN]

[MR]
Brrr[Beat] It's certainly colder now that[N]
we're outside the city.[AN]

[ML]
Keep your head in the game[,] Ser.[6N]
Can't let the absence of insulation[N]
distract you from the prize.[AN]

[MR]
Of course[,] Raial.[.6] Watch me work![6N]
They won't know what hit 'em![AN]

[ML]
Reminds me of my early mercenary days.[6N]
Out in the cold[,] cape billowing.[6N]
Didn't have a care in the world.[AN]

[MR]
Hey[Beat] I care![.6] I care about the rebellion[,][N]
the empire[Beat] and all you guys.[AN]

[ML]
I know[,] Ser.[.6] That's what's been on my mind.[AN]

[MR]
Don't fear[,] Raial.[.6] My eyes are solely[N]
focused on Aeteria's new dawn.[6N]
They don't stand a chance against us![AN]

[ML]
Ah[Beat] Nevermind.[.6] Let's go[,] lass![AN]

[MR]
Oh[,] Reverend.[.6] Are you feeling chilly as well?[6N]
I wish I brought warmer gear[,] but[N]
I just gotta run to warm up![AN]

[ML]
No[,] I am not necessarily cold.[6N]
Their forces are led by General Anton.[6N]
I worked with him as a court member.[AN]

[MR]
Bad blood[,] huh?[.6] Been there[,] done that.[6N]
I'll let you land the final blow[,][N]
just give me the signal.[AN]

[ML]
Perhaps in time.[.6] But more importantly[,][N]
their supplies are within our grasp.[6N]
Take what we can and burn the rest.[AN]

[MR]
Isn't that a little[Beat] unnecessary?[6N]
They'd think they were attacked by[N]
raiders of the north.[AN]

[ML]
We will need to take any scrap of[N]
resources that we can feasibly get[N]
our hands on[,] leader.[AN]
What better way to hone your powers[N]
than test them on the enemy?[.6][N]
Go on[,] destroy them.[AN]
