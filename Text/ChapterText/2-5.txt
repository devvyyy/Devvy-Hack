[L]
That was a close call.[.6] I'm glad we got out of[N]
the gates alive[,] scathed as we are[Beat][AN]

[R]
Heh[,] didn't even break a sweat.[.6] We just[N]
haveta keep on moving.[AN]

[FR]
Look over there.[.6] That's a lot of soldiers.[AN]

[R]
Yeah.[.6] Outside the capital city is a military[N]
encampment.[.6] We'll have to fight our way[N]
out of this one[,] to boot.[AN]

[FL]
The camp must contain equipment.[.6] If[N]
we can get ahold of it[,] I advise taking[N]
what we can and scorching the rest.[AN]

[R]
Burning isn't necessary.[.6] What[,] do[N]
you think us the barbarians of[N]
the North[,] Graham?[AN]

[FL]
Any advantage for us is a disadvantage for[N]
the empire.[.6] Surely they have [ToggleRed]useful[N]
equipment[ToggleRed] within the tents.[AN]

[R]
Not when we're trying to curry favor with[N]
[ToggleRed]Imperial generals[ToggleRed][Beat] I thought you[N]
were one for statecraft[,] Graham.[AN]

[FL]
Either way[,] it is our leader's choice.[6N]
I pray she makes the right one.[AN]

[L]
We can't afford to lose this battle.[6N]
I'll do anything[,] no matter the cost.[AN]

[MR]
Urgent news[,] my lord![.6] The Liberation[N]
Army approaches.[AN]

[ML]
The "Liberation Army"?[AN]

[MR]
Yes[,] that's what I said[,] sir.[AN]

[ML]
Of course[,] I concur.[.6] But can a group of[N]
thirty or so soldiers really be considered[N]
an army?[AN]

[MR]
Regardless of their numbers[,] they've[N]
gotten frighteningly far.[.6] We're afraid[N]
to face their next move.[AN]

[ML]
Afraid?[.6] Turn that fear into preparation[,][N]
son![.6] That snake in their army--[.4]Graham--[.4][N]
was of His Majesty's court.[AN]
They all decide to turn traitor and now they[N]
expect to be able to 'save' this country?[6N]
What do they expect to happen?[AN]

[MR]
And yet[,] what can we hope to do[,] sir?[6N]
With the assistance of that mercenary[,][N]
she's been like a beacon to the army.[AN]

[ML]
Then we must extinguish that light.[6n]
Come with me![.6] Not even the most guileful[N]
of snakes can evade my magic.[AN]
It's through pure ether that dreams come[N]
true[,] son![.6] I[,] General Bram Anton[,][N]
have not lost a single battle![AN][C]
Follow my orders[,] and my streak shall[N]
remain undefeated!![AN]

[MR]
What ruckus happened here?[AN]

[ML]
It's a one-man army[,] Major![.6] The mercenary[N]
who leads them[Beat] She massacred all of[N]
our men without mercy!![AN]

[MR]
WHat a grisly sight[Beat] And this was the[N]
work of the rebellion?[.6] Is the golden-eyed[N]
mercenary the one who leads them?[AN]

[ML]
They[Beat] They called her Chiffon.[.6] Said she[N]
would be the one to guide Aeteria to[N]
a new dawn.[AN]

[MR]
Such senseless rhetoric.[.6] Dreamers like her are[N]
the first to die.[.6] A new dawn?[.6] What hope[N]
could possibly come from such injustice?[AN]
The new age of Aeteria is meld and formed by[N]
us soldiers![.6] We are the ones who can[N]
save the empire.[AN]
I remain resolute.[.6] The rebels abhor the[N]
empire[Beat] Thus[,] they must be stopped[,] no[N]
matter the cost.[AN][C]
I will cull until naught a trace of this[N]
pathetic fight remains.[AN]

[ML]
Opali.[.6] Why[Beat] Must we really proceed with[N]
protecting the Count?[AN]

[MR]
General.[AN]

[ML]
The count is a contemptuous fool[,] hardly[N]
above a court jester.[.6] Do my words not[N]
suffice[,] Opali?[AN][C]
I almost want to lay down my arms[N]
and bide to be struck down.[AN]

[MR]
Wulfric[Beat] Mind your face.[AN]

[ML]
You understand[,] Opali[Beat] I[,] too[,] am vexed;[.4][N]
the Emperor and the Apostle[Beat] Even I can see[N]
that their reign is naught but madness.[AN]

[MR]
So the rebels have gotten their clutch[N]
upon your heart[,] too[,] then[Beat]?[AN]

[ML]
Sigh[Beat] If nothing else.[AN]
