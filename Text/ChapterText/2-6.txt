[3L]
[ML][Chiffon][R][Graham][FR][Raial]

[ML]
So[Beat] The count resides isolated in that[N]
fortress? We just have to take him out[,][N]
right?[.6] There's no way out for him.[AN]

[R]
Our priority is getting to the kingdom.[6N]
Count Locro is just another stepping[N]
stone in our way.[AN]
He carries charge of the fortress that[N]
borders the kingdom.[.6] They will vie to[N]
shield him[,] but they cannot deter us.[AN]

[FR]
I must give props to such a[N]
bold strategy.[.6] He even got the[N]
brown-nosin' Generals under him.[AN]

[R]
If we are done giving props[,] then I[N]
suggest proceeding with the siege.[AN]

[ML]
I've never fought anyone so high up the[N]
food chain before.[.6] It's almost thrilling.[AN]

[FR]
Don't get too stoked.[.6] I hear this[N]
guy has all sorts of lousy rumors[N]
surrounding him.[AN]

[R]
This will be an easy victory.[.6][N]
With Ser Chiffon's powers[,] we will tear[N]
through the fortress without worry.[AN]

[ML]
Yes[,] I'll make sure none of them escape.[AN]

[FR]
[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Everyone[,] get yourselves ready for the[N]
battle ahead![AN]

[ML][LoadFace][0x32][0x1] [R][Opal][FR][Wellington]
[ML]
A puny group of rebels?[.6] How preprosperous![6N]
We are[Beat] We're safe in here[,] yes?[6N]
You two![.6] His Majesty's favorites![AN]

[FR]
[Beat][AN]

[R]
Milord.[AN]

[ML]
Yes[,] yes.[.6] Under your command are a[N]
a fresh lot[,] but I am sure they are[N]
capable enough to protect me.[AN]
My life is of great military importance.[.6][N]
If even a single scratch of rebel scum[N]
gets on me[,] I'll be forced to[Beat][AN]

[FR]
Are these[Beat] new recruits?[.6] What manner of[N]
idiocy is this?![.6] They look like they've[N]
barely graduated the academy.[AN][C]
Why do you bring them to the battlefield?![6N]
In such a high-stakes battle?![AN]

[ML]
Silence[,] Wulfric![.6] Remember that I am above you[N]
generals.[.6] I will not hesitate to inform the[N]
Emperor of the army's[Beat] misbehavior.[AN][C]
This war is no small matter;[.4] we needed to deploy[N]
the reserves[,] no matter your whining.[.6][N]
Put those soldiers to use[,] yes?[AN]

[FR]
So he answers only to scoundrels like you.[6N]
How did a charlatan such as you become[N]
worthy of lordship?[AN]
We cannot allow unexperienced soldiers to[N]
fight in such an vital mission.[.6] If[N]
the rebels reach Wreyvine,[AN][C]
Aeteria will face a war like no other.[6N]
Many will die[,] milord.[an]

[R]
General[Beat] Drop it[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Peh[,] what does it matter?[.6] You should[N]
listen to your fellow General.[6N]
Now[Beat] Protect me![AN]

[FR]
[Beat][AN]

[R]
If the rebels dare to lay a finger on you[,][N]
know that I will strike them down.[AN]

[ML]
[Smile]What a perfect response[,] General Opali.[6N]
As expected by such an esteemed knight.[6N][Smile]
I shall look over this foul deed[,] Wulfric.[AN]
Know that you have the privilege of[N]
defending a count of Aeteria--[.4]I suggest[N]
you treasure this opportunity.[AN]

[FR]
Yes[,] Your Excellency[Beat][AN]

That soldier is shaking[Beat] Spear form's[N]
pretty bad[,] too.[AN]

[R]
Looks like a new recruit.[.6] What is this[,][N]
a school?[.6] Tell 'em to get out[,] this[N]
warzone ain't a playground![AN]

[ML]
There seems to be many.[.6] Imperial cannon fodder[,][N]
it seems.[.6] Hone your powers[,] leader.[6N]
[ToggleRed]Take their lives to further the cause.[ToggleRed][AN][CSS]

[FR][MoveRight]
[R]
Wait[,] I can't[Beat][AN]

[ML]
[Beat]Ser.[AN]

[FR]
Nah[,] they won't do us any harm.[.6][N]
They're hardly worthy enemies.[.6] I'm betting[N]
they won't even approach us out of fear.[AN]

[R]
I will not take the lives of someone who[N]
can hardly fend for themselves.[6N]
But[Beat] Even so[Beat][AN]

[FR]
Leader[Beat]?[.6] The [ToggleRed]Generals wouldn't like[N]
that one bit[ToggleRed]![.6] We're trying to get them[N]
on our side[,] here![AN]

[ML]
You must get stronger[,] Chiffon.[6N]
By any means necessary.[.6] Strike as[N]
your heart desires.[AN]

[MR]
That's that.[.6] There's nothing stopping[N]
us now.[AN]

[L]
Excellent work[,] leader.[.6] The foolish count[N]
meets his end at your hand.[.6][N]
This fortress is ours to claim.[an]

[FL]
Look at that;[.4] a snobby throne for a snobby[N]
man.[.6] Guess it doesn't matter when[n]
you get taken down.[AN]

[L]
Nothing matters when you pass this world.[6N]
No gold nor riches come with you to the[N]
realms beyond.[.6] Not even a crown.[AN]

[MR]
So what lies beyond these doors is[Beat][AN]

[FL]
Yup.[.6] Ideon's Bridge[,] our only way to the kingdom.[AN]

[MR]
Where did the Imperial generals go?[.6] I[N]
must've missed my chance to strike[Beat][AN]

[L]
They must have retreated[,] but stay on your[N]
guard[,] leader.[AN]

[MR]
With this[,] we pinned a target on our back.[6N]
We've no choice but to keep moving.[AN]

[L]
We have yet ample time to prepare--[.4]a short[n]
time[,] yes[,] but nonetheless it is enough[N]
to rest and prepare for our battles ahead.[an]

I bring ill omens[,] Consul Aoife.[AN]

[ML]
What're you flying all the way here for[,][N]
Messel?[.6] Trouble in paradise over there?[.6][N]
Or what[,] another kid blew up a building?[AN]

[MR][MoveRight]
Enough.[.6] Take this seriously[,] Consul.[6N]
You're promptly ordered to march for[n]
the borders.[AN]

[ML]
Huh?[.6] But I've only just returned[Beat][AN]

[R]
Count Locro has been killed by the rebels.[6n]
A thwarting pain at our side he was[,][n]
even to the end[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Huh.[.6] They've gotten bolder.[.6][N]
I never really liked that guy.[AN]

[R]
Consul.[.6] This calls for the Trinity's intervention[,][N]
does it not?[.6] Citizens of our holy empire[n]
are dying![AN][MoveRight]
They live in fear bcause of the rebels![6N]
The rebellion intend to combine forces[N]
with the angry kingdom soldiers.[AN]
if they join forces[,] that is when the[N]
war escalates.[.6] That is when the state[N]
of affairs become dire![AN]

[ML]
Yes[,] I do agree that somebody has to[N]
do something.[.6] But what of the other[N]
consuls?[AN]

[R]
The other consuls are occupied.[.6] I presume they[N]
are ruling--in other words[,] doing their[N]
active duty as a consul.[AN]

[ML]
Sigh[Beat] Sure.[.6] I'll take off for the border.[AN]

[R]
You must head with haste[,] General.[6N]
Allow me to lead the way.[.6] Under no[N]
circumstance can the rebels break through.[AN]

Hah![.6] All bad things[,] I assume.[6N]

I cannot find myself to fight you.[AN]

[MR]
Then why don't you come with us?[AN]

[ML]
To help the people of the rebellion[Beat][N]
