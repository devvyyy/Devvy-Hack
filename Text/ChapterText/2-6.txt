Chiffon
So[Beat] The count resides isolated in that fortress?[N]
We just have to take him out[,] right?[6N]
There's no way out for him.[AN]

Graham
Our main priority is getting to Wreyvine.[6N]
Count Locro is just another stepping[N]
stone in our way.[AN]
He carries charge of the fortress that borders[N]
the kingdom.[6N] They will vie to protect[N]
him[,] but we are unstoppable.[AN]

Raya
Yup.[.6] A real noble sad sack[,] Locro is.[6N]
He's a real enigma[,] I hear. Plenty of[N]
lousy rumors surrounding him.[AN]

Chiffon
I've never fought anyone so high up the[N]
food chain before.[.6] It's almost thrilling.[AN]

Raya
Don't get too stoked.[AN]

Verna
This won't be an easy one[,] leader--[.4]seems the[N]
Imperial generals are his personal lackies today.[AN]

Raya
Sheeesh[,] must be a big shot.[.6] But huh[Beat][N]
again?[.6] They must be as tired as we are.[AN]

Graham
Fear not.[.6] This will be an easy victory.[.6][N]
With Chiffon's powers[,] we will tear through[N]
the fortress and push forwards.[AN]

Chiffon
Yes[,] I'll make sure none of them escape.[AN]

Raya
[Beat][AN]

Chiffon
Everyone[,] get yourselves ready for the battle ahead![AN]

Locro
A small group of rebels?[.6] How preprosperous![6N]
You all are a fresh lot[,] but I am sure you're[N]
worthy to guard one of my status.[AN][C]
If even a single scratch of rebel scum[N]
gets on me[,] I'll be forced to[Beat][AN]

Wulfric
Are these[Beat] new recruits?[.6] What manner of idiocy[N]
is this?![.6] They look like they have barely[N]
graduated the academy.[AN][C]
Why do you bring them to the battlefield?![AN]

Locro
Quiet[,] Wulfric! Remember that I am above you[N]
generals.[.6] I will not hesitate to inform the[N]
Emperor of the army's misbehavior.[AN][C]
This war is no small matter;[.4] we needed to deploy[N]
the reserves[,] no matter your whining.[AN]

Wulfric
So he answers only to scoundrels like you.[6N]
How did a charlatan such as you become worthy[N]
of lordship?[AN][C]
We cannot allow unexperienced soldiers to fight in[N]
such an important mission.[an]

Opal
General[Beat] Drop it[Beat]

Locro
Peh[,] what does it matter?[.6] They're equally capable[N]
in preventing the rebels from reaching me.[AN]

Wulfric
[Beat][AN]

Locro
I shall look over this foul deed[,] Wulfric.[6N]
You have the privilege of defending a count[N]
of Aeteria--[.4]treasure this opportunity.[AN]

Wulfric
Yes[,] Your Excellency[Beat][AN]

Chiffon
That soldier is shaking[Beat][AN]

Raya
Looks like a new recruit.[.6] What is this[,] a circus?[.6] Tell 'em to get out[,] this isn't a playground!

Graham
There seems to be many.[.6] Imperial cannon fodder[,][N]
it seems.[.6] Hone your powers[,] leader.[6N]
Take their lives to further the cause.[AN]

Chiffon
Wait[,] I can't[Beat][AN]

Graham
[Beat][AN]

Raya
Nah[,] they won't do us any harm.[.6][N]
They're hardly worthy enemies.[.6] I'm betting[N]
they won't approach us out of fear.[AN]

Chiffon
I will not take the lives of fresh recruits.
But[Beat] Even so[Beat][AN]

Chiffon
That's that. There's nothing stopping us now.

Graham
Excellent work[,] leader. The foolish count is dead. This fortress is ours.

Raya
Look at that; a snobby throne for a snobby man. Guess it doesn't matter when you get taken down.

Graham
Nothing matters when you pass this world. The crown does not come with you to the realms beyond.

Chiffon
So what lies beyond these doors is[Beat]

Raya
Yup. Ideon's Bridge[,] our only way to the kingdom.

Chiffon
Where did the Imperial generals go?

Graham
They must have retreated[,] but stay on your guard[,] leader.

Chiffon
With this[,] we pinned a target on our back. We've no choice but to keep moving.

Graham
We have time to prepare--a short time[,] yes[,] but nonetheless it is enough to rest and prepare for our battles ahead.

Messel
I bring ill omens[,] Consul Aoife.

Aoife
What're you flying all the way here for[,] Messel?[.6] Trouble in paradise over there?[.6] What[,] another mage blew up a building?

Messel
Enough. Take this seriously[,] Consul. You're promptly ordered to march for the border.

Aoife
Huh?[.6] But I've only just returned[Beat]

Messel
Count Locro has been killed by the rebels. A thwarting pain at our side he was[,] even to the end[Beat]

Aoife
Huh. They've gotten bolder. I never really liked that guy.

Messel
Consul. This calls for the Trinity's intervention[,] does it not?[.6] Citizens of our holy empire are dying; living in fear due to the rebels! The Rebels intend to infiltrate Wreyvine; if they join forces[,] that is when the war begins. That is when everything becomes dire!

Aoife
Yes[,] I do agree that somebody has to do something. But what of Maynard and Eustace?

Messel
The other consuls are busy. I presume they are ruling--in other words[,] doing their duty as a consul.

Aoife
Sigh[Beat].. Sure. I'll take off for the border.

Messel
You must head with haste[,] General. Allow me to lead the way. We cannot let the rebels break through to Wreyvine under any circumstance.
