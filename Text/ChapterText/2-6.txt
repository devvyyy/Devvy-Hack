[ML]
So[Beat] The count resides isolated in that[N]
fortress? We just have to take him out[,][N]
right?[.6] There's no way out for him.[AN]

[R]
Our priority is getting to the kingdom.[6N]
Count Locro is just another stepping[N]
stone in our way.[AN]
He carries charge of the fortress that[N]
borders the kingdom.[.6] They will vie to[N]
shield him[,] but they cannot deter us.[AN]

[FR]
So he's the kingdom's gatekeeper[,] huh?[.6] We[N]
remove him[,] and we open the floodgates.[AN]

[R]
The gates are already open[,] Raial.[6N]
They already tremble hearing our name.[AN]

[FR]
Yeah, yeah.[.6] He pulled a couple of Imperial[N]
generals to guard him too[Beat] must've heard[N]
the rumors about us already.[AN]

[ML]
I've never fought anyone so high up the[N]
food chain before.[.6] It's almost thrilling.[AN]

[FR]
Don't get too stoked.[.6] I hear this[N]
guy has all sorts of lousy rumors[N]
surrounding him.[AN]

[R]
This will be an easy victory.[.6][N]
With Ser Chiffon's powers[,] we will tear[N]
through the fortress without worry.[AN]

[ML]
Yes[,] I'll make sure none of them escape.[AN]

[FR]

[ML]
Everyone[,] get ready![.6] There's no stopping now.[6][N]
We'll leave nothing but ashes behind us.[AN]

[ML]
So[Beat] the count hides himself away[N]
in that fortress?[.6] If we strike now[,][N]
we can cut through his defenses[Beat][AN]
and free the path to the kingdom.[AN]

[R]
Our priority is getting to the kingdom.[6N]
Count Locro is just another stepping[N]
stone in our way.[AN]
He carries charge of the fortress that[N]
borders the kingdom.[.6] They will vie to[N]
shield him[,] but they cannot deter us.[AN]

[FR]
I must give props to such a bold strategy.[.6][N]
He even got the brown-nosing generals[N]
under him.[AN]

[R]
His connections bought him this army[,][N]
but they won't save him.[AN]

[ML]
Gotta give him some credit though--[.4]pulling[N]
the generals to his side just to hold[N]
his walls?[.6] Ha![an]

[R]
If we are done giving unfounded credit[,][N]
then I suggest proceeding with the siege.[AN]

[ML]
Still[,] this is our biggest target yet.[.6][N]
A noble who thinks he can stand[N]
above the people.[.6] [MoveML]Not anymore![AN]

[FR][MoveFarRight]
That's more like it[,] lass![.6] Let's topple this[N]
smug bastard and show 'em what real[N]
change looks like![AN]

[R]
This siege will echo beyond the fortress walls.[.6][N]
Your victory here will ignite hope in the[N]
hearts of the empire's people.[AN]
This will be an effortless victory.[.6][N]
With Ser Chiffon's powers[,] we will tear[N]
through the fortress without worry.[AN]

[ML]
Yeah.[.6] Lots of battles ahead[,] but we're[N]
so close to seeing a brighter tomorrow.[AN]

[FR]
Right.[.6] We'll win this the right way.[6N]
I'll carve a path[,] just follow me.[AN]

[ML]
Yes[,] yes.[.6] Under your command are a[N]
a fresh lot[,] but I am sure they are[N]
capable enough to protect me.[AN]
My life is of great military importance.[.6][N]
Not a single Northern wretch has passed[N]
through Imperial borders under my watch.[AN]
You Generals must do your part as well.[6N]
If even a single scratch of rebel scum[N]
gets on me[,] I'll be forced to[Beat][AN]

[FR]
Are these[Beat] new recruits?[.6] What manner of[N]
idiocy is this?![.6] They look like they've[N]
barely graduated the academy.[AN][C]
Why do you bring them to the battlefield?![6N]
In such a high-stakes battle?![AN]

[ML]
Silence[,] Wulfric![.6] Remember that I am above you[N]
generals.[.6] I will not hesitate to inform the[N]
Emperor of the army's[Beat] misbehavior.[AN]
This war is no small matter;[.4] we needed to[N]
deploy the reserves[,] no matter your whining.[.6][N]
Put those soldiers to use[,] yes?[AN]

[FR]
So he answers only to scoundrels like you.[6N]
How did a charlatan such as you become[N]
worthy of lordship?[AN]
We cannot allow inexperienced soldiers to[N]
fight in such an vital mission.[.6] If[N]
the rebels reach Wreyvine,[AN][C]
Aeteria will face a war like no other.[6N]
Many will die[,] milord.[an]

If the rebels dare to lay a finger on you[,][N]
know that I will strike them down.[AN]

[ML]
[Smile]What a perfect response[,] General Opali.[6N]
As expected by such an esteemed knight.[6N][Smile]
I shall look over this foul deed[,] Wulfric.[AN]

[MR]
That's that.[.6] The count's fallen.[6N]
No one stands in our way now.[AN]

[L]
Excellent work[,] leader.[.6] Count Locro falls[,][N]
and this fortress is ours to claim.[6N]
This will be a turning point.[an]

[FL]
Look at that;[.4] a snobby throne for a snobby[N]
man.[.6] Guess it doesn't matter when[n]
you get taken down.[AN]

[L]
Nothing matters when you pass this world.[6N]
Neither gold nor riches come with you to[N]
the realms beyond.[.6] Not even a crown.[AN]
And history will remember this.[.6][N]
The day the rebellion crossed the threshold[N]
into the kingdom itself.[AN]

[MR]
So what lies beyond these doors is[Beat][N]
Ideon's Bridge[,] our only path forward.[AN]

[FL]
That's right.[6] No turning back now[,] lass.[.6][N]
The empire's finest will try to hold us there.[.6][N]
But we'll break them.[AN]

[MR]
The generals we fought--[.4]did they retreat?[6N]
I didn't even notice when they slipped away.[AN]

[L]
They must have fallen back to the bridge.[.6][N]
I would wager they'll fortify their[N]
positions there.[AN][C]
We should not expect our coming battles[N]
to be so simple.[AN]

[FL]
Let 'em try.[6] We've pushed this far.[.6] We just[N]
gotta push a little further and the kingdom's[N]
gates will swing open.[AN]

[MR]
With this[,] we pinned a target on our back.[6N]
We've no choice but to keep moving.[AN]

[FL]
We've come too far to turn back now.[.6][N]
Even if they all come down on us[,][N]
we won't stop.[AN]

We have yet ample time to prepare--[.4]a short[n]
time[,] yes[,] but nonetheless it is enough[N]
to rest and prepare for our battles ahead.[an]

A flawless execution[,] leader.[.6] The foolish count[N]
meets his end at your hand.[.6][N]
He played his hand[,] and we crushed it.[AN]

[MR]
Of course.[.6] He should've ran while he[N]
still had the chance.[AN]

[L]
The count's life meant little in the grand[N]
design[,] but his death opens a critical[N]
path for us.[AN]

Yeah[,] yeah.[.6] In the end[,] titles don't mean a[N]
damn thing when you're lying in the dirt.[AN]

Illusions that dissolve the moment your[N]

Where did the Imperial generals go?[.6] I[N]

You will have your chance[,] leader.[6N]
They can continue to flee[,] but your arrows[N]
are inevitable.[AN]

[MR]
So beyond these doors[Beat][N]
We'll greet them all soon.[AN]

[FL]
Yup.[.6] Ideon's Bridge[,] our only way to the kingdom.[.6][N]
They'll be waiting for us there.[AN][AN]

[L]
Without question.[.6] The Imperial generals will have[N]
regrouped.[.6] They will station their remaining[N]
forces to bottleneck us there.[AN]

[L]
Sacrifices are inevitable.[.6] If they fear us[,] they[N]
surrender faster.[.6] If they resist[,] they perish.[AN]

[MR]
With this[,] we pinned a target on our back.[6N]
But that doesn't matter now[,] right?[6N]
There's only one way to proceed.[AN]

[L]
Precisely.[.6] We must keep pressing forward and[N]
strike before they can rebuild.[AN]

[FL]
Don't get too ahead of yourselves[,] alright?[6N]
Let's just hope we can still walk the line.[AN]

[L]
We have yet ample time to prepare--[.4]a short[n]
time[,] yes[,] but nonetheless it is enough[N]
