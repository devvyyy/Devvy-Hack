Chiffon
So[Beat] The count resides isolated in that fortress?[N]
We just have to take him out[,] right?[6N]
There's no way out for him.[AN]

Graham
Our main priority is getting to Wreyvine.[6N]
Count Locro is just another stepping[N]
stone in our way.[AN]
He carries charge of the fortress that borders[N]
the kingdom.[6N] They will vie to protect[N]
him[,] but we are unstoppable.[AN]

Raya
I must give props to such a[N]
bold strategy.[.6] He even got the[N]
brown-nosin' Generals under him.[AN]

Graham
If we are done giving props[,] then I[N]
suggest moving forward.[AN]

Chiffon
I've never fought anyone so high up the[N]
food chain before.[.6] It's almost thrilling.[AN]

Raya
Don't get too stoked.[AN]

Graham
This will be an easy victory.[.6][N]
With Chiffon's powers[,] we will tear through[N]
the fortress without worry.[AN]

Chiffon
Yes[,] I'll make sure none of them escape.[AN]

Raya
[Beat][AN]

Chiffon
Everyone[,] get yourselves ready for the battle ahead![AN]

[ML][Locro] [R][Opal][FR][Wulfric]
A small group of rebels?[.6] How preprosperous![6N]
We are[Beat] We're safe in here[,] yes?[6N]
You two![.6] His Majesty's favorites![AN]

[FR]
[Beat][AN]

[R]
Milord.[AN]

[ML]
Yes[,] yes.[.6] Under your command are a
a fresh lot[,] but I am sure they are[N]
capable enough to protect me.[AN]
My life is of great military importance.[.6][N]
If even a single scratch of rebel scum[N]
gets on me[,] I'll be forced to[Beat][AN]

[FR]
Are these[Beat] new recruits?[.6] What manner of[N]
idiocy is this?![.6] They look like they've[N]
barely graduated the academy.[AN][C]
Why do you bring them to the battlefield?![6N]
In such a high-stakes battle?![AN]

Locro
Silence[,] Wulfric![.6] Remember that I am above you[N]
generals.[.6] I will not hesitate to inform the[N]
Emperor of the army's[Beat] misbehavior.[AN][C]
This war is no small matter;[.4] we needed to deploy[N]
the reserves[,] no matter your whining.[.6][N]
Put those soldiers to use[,] yes?[AN]

[FR]
So he answers only to scoundrels like you.[6N]
How did a charlatan such as you become worthy[N]
of lordship?[AN][C]
We cannot allow unexperienced soldiers to fight[N]
in such an vital mission.[.6] If the rebels[N]
reach Wreyvine,[AN][C]
Aeteria will face a war like no other.[6N]
Many will die[,] milord.[an]

[R]
General[Beat] Drop it[Beat]

[ML]
Peh[,] what does it matter?[.6] You should[N]
listen to your fellow General.[6N]
Now[Beat] Protect me![AN]

[FR]
[Beat][AN]

[ML]
I shall look over this foul deed[,] Wulfric.[6N]
You have the privilege of defending a count[N]
of Aeteria--[.4]treasure this opportunity.[AN]

[FR]
Yes[,] Your Excellency[Beat][AN]

Chiffon
That soldier is shaking[Beat][AN]

Raya
Looks like a new recruit.[.6] What is this[,][N]
a school?[.6] Tell 'em to get out[,] this[N]
warzone ain't a playground![AN]

Graham
There seems to be many.[.6] Imperial cannon fodder[,][N]
it seems.[.6] Hone your powers[,] leader.[6N]
Take their lives to further the cause.[AN]

Chiffon
Wait[,] I can't[Beat][AN]

Graham
[Beat][AN]

Raya
Nah[,] they won't do us any harm.[.6][N]
They're hardly worthy enemies.[.6] I'm betting[N]
they won't even approach us out of fear.[AN]

Chiffon
I will not take the lives of fresh recruits.
But[Beat] Even so[Beat][AN]

Leader?

You must get stronger[,] Chiffon. By any means necessary.

Aaaah!![.6] The enemies are inside the castle![6N]
You fools couldn't hold them back?![6N]
I must move to a safer position[Beat][AN]

Chiffon
That's that. There's nothing stopping us now.

Graham
Excellent work[,] leader. The foolish count is dead. This fortress is ours.

Raya
Look at that; a snobby throne for a snobby man. Guess it doesn't matter when you get taken down.

Graham
Nothing matters when you pass this world. The crown does not come with you to the realms beyond.

Chiffon
So what lies beyond these doors is[Beat]

Raya
Yup. Ideon's Bridge[,] our only way to the kingdom.

Chiffon
Where did the Imperial generals go?

Graham
They must have retreated[,] but stay on your guard[,] leader.

Chiffon
With this[,] we pinned a target on our back. We've no choice but to keep moving.

Graham
We have time to prepare--a short time[,] yes[,] but nonetheless it is enough to rest and prepare for our battles ahead.

Messel
I bring ill omens[,] Consul Aoife.

Aoife
What're you flying all the way here for[,] Messel?[.6] Trouble in paradise over there?[.6] What[,] another mage blew up a building?

Messel
Enough. Take this seriously[,] Consul. You're promptly ordered to march for the border.

Aoife
Huh?[.6] But I've only just returned[Beat]

Messel
Count Locro has been killed by the rebels. A thwarting pain at our side he was[,] even to the end[Beat]

Aoife
Huh. They've gotten bolder. I never really liked that guy.

Messel
Consul. This calls for the Trinity's intervention[,] does it not?[.6] Citizens of our holy empire are dying; living in fear due to the rebels! The Rebels intend to infiltrate Wreyvine; if they join forces[,] that is when the war begins. That is when everything becomes dire!

Aoife
Yes[,] I do agree that somebody has to do something. But what of Maynard and Eustace?

Messel
The other consuls are busy. I presume they are ruling--in other words[,] doing their duty as a consul.

Aoife
Sigh[Beat].. Sure. I'll take off for the border.

Messel
You must head with haste[,] General. Allow me to lead the way. We cannot let the rebels break through to Wreyvine under any circumstance.
