Their vessels are the only ones who[N]
can use Ideon's twin treasures.[AN]
We're no longer in the brink of war.[.6] We[N]
cannot let them have either treasure.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Yes,[.4] Mother[Beat]

Graham,[.4] are you sure it's safe?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
"Safe"?[.6] Princess,[.4] we cannot let[N]
fear entrap us in the dark.[AN]
Nothing about this mission is safe.[.6][N] We[N]

simple enough.[AN]
Just in-and-out,[.4][N]
quick and easy.[.6][N]
We'll be back at the capital[N]
by ship soon enough.[N]

[OpenRight]
That's way more idealistic than I was[N]
expecting from you,[.4] Cortado.[AN]

I sure hope this will be[N]
quick and easy[Beat][AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
There is no room in your heart[N]

princess?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes,[.4] her forces are infiltrating[N]
the underground passage.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]This has got to be[N]
some sort of joke?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]No,[.4] sir.[.6] Aeteria has really sent[N]
their crown princess,[.4] armed, to Wreyvine.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]This is[Beat] absurd.[.6] Everyone,[.4] move out.[.6][N]

[OpenMidLeft]I don't feel ready for[N]
this,[.4] Graham[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidRight]You are the light the people look[N]
up to when the night is upon us.[AN]
Remember what you have learned:[.6] every[N]
slash,[.4] every step.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It's not that I'm worried about[N]
my abilities[Beat][AN]
I don't feel like[Beat] cutting[N]
people down.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]If we do nothing,[.4] the Wreyvians will[N]
cast us back into the shadows.[AN]
Another rebirth of Ideon will[N]
sear into the soil.[AN]
Chiffon,[.4] you are the weapon our[N]
kingdom needs.[AN]
You must make a life of death, be the[N]
crest of our faith.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
A crest of our faith[Beat]?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
It's a terrifying first step,[.4][N]
princess.[AN]
But it is a necessary one: Aeteria's[N]
future rests on all of us.[AN]
When your steps falter,[.4] follow[N]
us.[.6] Keep your faith with each step[Beat][AN]
