[OpenFarLeft]
[Pause]The attack on Wreyvine's Pale[N]
Palace was but a few moons ago.[AN]
A reminder,[.4] princess Chiffon,[.4] that you were[N]
supposed to lead our soldiers there.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Well,[.4] you missed the part where I[N]
swooped in and took the Eye![AN]
Glad I'm able to clean up[N]
her mess. [Pause]Again.[AN]
[MoveLeft]
Hell yeah,[.4] bless the Ashen[N]
Rider tonight![.6] Woo![AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Please stop.[.6] [MidBlink][Pause]Why do you do[N]
this to me,[.4] Aoife?[AN][OpenEyes]

[OpenLeft]
You know what you need,[.4] Maynard?[.6][N]
Some excitement in your life![AN]
Like come on,[.4] live[N]
a little.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
I tuned out every obnoxious word,[.4][N]
I'm so sorry I can't hear you.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
I'm sorry for my failure.[.6] I was distracted[N]
by Eustace's[Beat] creations.[AN]
We got what we wanted.[.6] There's[N]
nothing more to it,[.4] right?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Correct.[.6] All that remains is[N]
holding the Wreyvians off.[AN]
They will doubtless send forces to[N]
claim the Eye of Creation back.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Our captured remain in the Pale Palace,[.4][N]
but we cannot risk any more losses.[AN]

[OpenFarRight][Pause]Cannot risk any[N]
more losses?[AN]
These are our people![.6] It's our duty[N]
to rescue them from Wreyvine![AN]

[OpenLeft]
I'm sorry,[.4] princess Chiffon, but[N]
as you can tell,[.4] the Aeterian army[AN]
currently has more pressing[N]
matters to attend to.[AN]
Especially when it was your mishap[N]
that led them down that path.[AN]
All of those forces,[.4] and no one to guide[N]
them,[.4] and you didn't say a word.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
Look,[.4] let me prove myself.[.6][N]
I won't screw it up this time![AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Defending Aeteria is of upmost[N]
priority at the time.[AN]
We have no room for any mistakes[N]
in our current position.[AN]
As such, you,[.4] princess,[.4] must stay[N]
behind.[.6] Is that clear?[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Even so,[.4] the captives served Aeteria and[N]
achieved glory for the cause.[AN]
I suppose we can rescue them later[N]
if we have time to spare.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.4]

[OpenFarRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveRight]
'Later'[Beat]?[.6] I wasn't aware of the[N]
captives until today![AN]
How could the Trinity act[N]
so[Beat] primitive?![AN]
We must go to Wreyvine and rescue[N]
them![.6] I'll go if I must.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
My apologies,[.4] but the Queen requires[N]
us to be elsewhere.[AN]
You too,[.4] princess.[.6] Your mother[N]
wants you to stay on guard nearby.[AN]
Aeter Citadel to the South is a small[N]
fortress that will need a defense.[AN]
It's the least risky position for[N]
you to defend it,[.4] princess.[AN]
You are to guard the citadel at all[N]
costs,[.4] as Aeteria's blade.[AN]
Any comments,[.4] suggestions,[.4][N]
jokes,[.4] or threats?[AN]

[OpenRight]
I[Beat] But[Beat][AN]

[OpenFarLeft]That's a 'No'?[AN]

[Event]

[OpenLeft]
[Pause]Come on,[.4] seriously?[.6] Does the heir[N]
to Aeteria dare to defy the crown,[AN]
dare to turn away from[N]
our faithful[Beat]?[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
[Beat][AN]

[OpenRight]
No,[.4] of course not.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Remember:[.4] you are the secret weapon[N]
that Aeteria needs in her last hour.[AN]
The moon's glow slumbers[N]
within you,[.4] Chiffon.[AN]
The more you bleed,[.4] the more[N]
you shine.[AN]
Yet your time is not now.[.6] Stay[N]
on guard for Wreyvian soldiers.[AN]

[OpenRight]
I[Beat][AN]

[OpenLeft]
Did you not hear us the[N]
first time?[AN]
You have been assigned to guard[N]
Fort Aeter to the South.[AN]
It is of historical and devout[N]
importance.[AN]
I believe this is your chance to shine[N]
under the Ashen Rider's moonlight.[AN]

[OpenRight]
[Pause]Understood[Beat] I[Beat] I will[N]
not fail Aeteria.[AN][X]

## Ch7Opening1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGraham][OpenMidRight][LoadChiffon]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]Graham![.6] Why didn't you stand[N]
up for me?[AN]
So much for being my[N]
loyal retainer[Beat][AN]
We have to rescue those Aeterian[N]
prisoners.[AN]
What else was all of my training[N]
and preparation for?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Your training is in case you're[N]
in unexpected danger,[AN]
not for when you're blindly rushing[N]
into enemy territory.[AN]
I agree with the Trinity:[.4] your foolish[N]
actions are not worth the risk.[AN]
What would Aeteria do without its[N]
crown princess?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I dunno,[.4] just have the Trinity[N]
handle political stuff.[AN]
I barely contribute to politics,[.4] I'm[N]
pretty much an Aeterian soldier.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
To defy your mother would mean[N]
defying the Queen herself[Beat][AN]
The crown princess of Aeteria would[N]
be branded a traitor.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I know what I'm doing,[.4] Graham.[.6][N]
No one will know we left.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
You don't know what you're doing,[.4] nor do[N]
you know the consequences of your actions.[AN]
You cannot shirk the royal duties[N]
to which you were born.[AN]
Unless you have a plan,[.4] we will[N]
not proceed with this folly.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
[Pause]I have a plan.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Ugh[Beat] [ToggleSmile]Alright,[.4] I'll humor[N]
you.[.6] Go.[AN][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidRight]
So we go to Wreyvine by boat-[N]
infiltrate the Pale Palace,[AN]
rescue the prisoners,[.4] and leave[N]
undetected.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]The Wreyvians realize we're good,[.4][N]
and the war ends![.6] Ta-da![AN][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidLeft]
First off,[.4] we are not using[N]
my boat.[AN]
Duskwave is a fishing boat.[.6] I will not[N]
tarnish her good name.[AN]
Second,[.4] you're very naive if you think your[N]
imaginary actions will end this war.[AN]
Actually,[.4] you're naive for also thinking the[N]
first part of your plan will work[Beat][AN]
It seems like less of a plan and[N]
more like a bucket list.[AN]

[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
Those Aeterians are relying[N]
on us,[.4] Graham.[AN]
They need us in their hour[N]
of despair[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Chiffon,[.4] you're persistent as always,[.4][N]
I'll give you that.[AN]
But resolve will not shield you from[N]
Wreyvine's famed spears and arrows.[AN]
[Pause]Especially when you don't know[N]
anything about magic.[AN]

[OpenRight][MoveRight]
One chance.[.6] Please,[.4] Graham.[.6][N]
I'm not leaving until you agree.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Ugh,[.4] for-[AN]

[OpenRight][MoveLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]
[OpenLeft]
Please.[.6] Believe in the Ashen Rider.[.6][N]
Isn't that what you always said?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
What?[.6] I[Beat] Fine.[.6] You win.[.6] [CloseEyes]I don't[N]
want to deal with this.[AN][OpenEyes]
[Pause]Rally the others,[.4] Chiffon. We set[N]
off for Wreyvine's Pale Palace now.[AN]
It's our only chance to make it[N]
before twilight.[AN]

[OpenLeft][MoveLeft]
[ToggleSmile]Yes![.6] I knew you'd see my[N]
side,[.4] Graham.[AN][ClearFace]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
But I didn't[Beat] [CloseEyes]Nevermind.[AN][X]

Everything is so[Beat] shiny[Beat][AN]
It's much colder here,[.4][N]

There's an underground passage[N]

not sure if I'm ready.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]

expecting from you,[.4] Cortado.[AN]

If we do nothing,[.4] the Wreyvians will[N]

We'll be trapped into another[N]

You must make a life of death, be the[N]
crest of our faith.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]It's difficult to hear around[N]
inside a concrete cell[Beat][AN]

[OpenFarRight]Do you think the rumors[N]
were true?[AN]
That the King of Wreyvine was planning[N]
Aeteria's end and Wreyvine's rebirth?[AN][ClearFace]

[OpenFarRight][LoadWilken]I don't see what's so[N]
hard to believe.[AN]
They Wreyvians are looking to repeat[N]
history,[.4] or so they say.[AN][ClearFace][LoadCortado]

[OpenLeft]
Well,[.4] apparently all of the texts[N]
and scripts were gathered by one person.[AN]
What was his name again?[.6] Some Wreyvian[N]
advisor named Gargoyle?[.6] Galagar?[AN]

[OpenRight]
Ah,[.4] right.[.6] Her Majesty told it was the[N]
advisor's influence that forced our hand.[AN]
[Pause]That he would prove to be more[N]
dangerous than any other soldier.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
You sure this isn't some tall tale and[N]
this guy ain't some mega-loser?[AN]
I mean,[.4] General Aoife just swooped in[N]
and took the Eye.[.6] No resistance.[AN]
Even General Maynard was impressed-[.4][N]
that man's stone-cold![AN]

[OpenFarRight]
None of us can say.[.6] I mean,[.4][N]
were you not there,[.4] Verna?[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Well,[.4] I wasn't really focused[N]
on the throne room.[AN]
There were so many archers to[N]
focus on,[.4] y'know?[AN]
Like there was this green guy who[N]
kept running back and forth.[AN]
How am I supposed to keep up[N]
with that?[AN]
Actually,[.4] he seemed kind of[N]
familiar[Beat][AN]

[OpenFarLeft][Pause]I may have seen him;[.4] the[N]
pale man with the crow?[AN]
He was recently assigned as[N]
their King's right-hand.[AN]
I hear his hallowed magic is[N]
quite potent.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadJaye]
Eh,[.4] the Wreyvians all talk big,[N]
but they'll break.[AN]
Even their holy guard full of armored[N]
monks don't stand a chance against us![AN]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
Hey,[.4] there's the shore![A][X]

[OpenMidRight]
The scouts have returned from the[N]

[OpenMidRight]
The battle to guard the Aeter Citadel[N]
was lost,[.4] my lady.[AN]
It has been claimed by[N]
Wreyvian forces.[AN]
General Maynard is on his way[N]
to clean up the fallen.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Aeter Citadel[Beat][.6] Was[N]
princess Chiffon hurt?![AN]

[OpenMidRight]
[Pause]Princess Chiffon was seen leaving the[N]
harbor with a group of soldiers.[AN]

[Event]

[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
PFFFFT-[.4] What?![.6] I'm dreaming,[.4] this[N]
is some sort of cruel jest.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Not at all.[.6] I fear the rumors of[N]
her turning traitor was true after all[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
First she abandons her duties at[N]
the palace,[.4] now this?[AN]
Does little Chiffon really intend[N]
on betraying her own kingdom?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
It's unfortunate to see such young light[N]
waver in faith[Beat][AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Pause]Heya,[.4] Princess Chiffon.[AN]

[OpenRight]

[OpenMidLeft]
Tell me I'm dreaming or otherwise[N]
witnessing a prank, princess.[AN]

[OpenRight]
[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
*sigh* Alright,[.4] here's the gist:[.4][N]
you stand accused of treason.[AN]
Would the princess of Aeteria please[N]
explain her excursion to Wreyvine?[AN]

[OpenRight]
Aoife[Beat] I saved the prisoners[N]
kept in the Pale Palace![AN]

[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
You defied Her Majesty's orders,[.4] and[N]
abandoned your station-[.4] leaving[AN]
our soldiers to fend[N]
for themselves-[.4] again![AN]
You sailed to Wreyvine,[.4] blew up[N]
Wreyvine's Pale Palace,[AN]
rescued the prisoners,[.4] left[N]
behind naught but ashes and dust,[AN]
therefore leaving behind a trail[N]
towards Aeteria,[AN]
and you have the gall to[N]
come back here.[AN]
How could you abandon your soldiers[N]
in their time of need again?[AN]

[OpenRight]
But[Beat] I[Beat][AN]

[OpenLeft]
That's a-[.4]okay.[.6] I'm willing to give[N]
you a second chance.[AN]

[OpenRight]
[Pause]Second chance?[.6] You don't dare think you[N]
have the moral high ground?[AN]
You left these prisoners to[N]
fester for far too long![AN]

[OpenLeft]
We were going to save them eventually-[.4][N]
we're in a war,[.4] we don't have time.[AN]

[OpenRight]
Then get your priorities[N]
straight![AN]
I just did what the Trinity all[N]
needed to do.[AN]

What we needed to do[Beat]? Your naivete[N]
is leading this nowhere.[AN]
Looks like we have to go[N]
back to plan A.[AN][Event]

[OpenMidLeft]
I have been[Beat] ordered by the Queen[N]
to incinerate you to ashes.[AN]
Natural heating,[.4] you know?[.6][N]
It has been pretty cold lately.[AN]
Understand?[.6] I can't let the heir of Aeteria[N]
disgrace her as you stand now.[AN]

[OpenRight]
People look up to you as a hero.[.6][N]
I looked up to you as a hero.[AN]
Some [OpenQuote]hero" you ended[N]
up being![AN]

[OpenFarRight]
Princess,[.4] I suggest we[N]
retreat-[.4] now.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
And you,[.4] Graham.[.6] Are you willing[N]
to really go along with her folly?[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
There is no folly here,[.4][N]
General Aoife.[AN]
This is righteous-[.4] we should've set[N]
out for them many moons ago.[AN]
Isolated in darkness,[.4] weighing[N]
upon them[Beat][AN]
This is exactly the tragedy we hoped to[N]
avoid by taking the Eye of Creation.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
You defy Her Majesty too,[.4][N]
Graham?[AN]
To think in a single night,[.4] Aeteria[N]
would lose such loyalty[Beat][AN]
Flee if you must.[.6] If you stay here,[.4][N]
I must take action for your betrayal.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]

the only useful part about her[N]
