Oh, phew! I thought I was gonna[N]
be stuck in that cell forever[Beat][AN]

Princess Chiffon. You were only in[N]
there for a few hours.[AN]

I didn't expect for us to get[N]
captured like that![AN]

Yeah. You guys getting captured[N]
is totally inexcusable.[AN]

Polly! Don't say that[Beat][AN]

Alright, let's get outta here![AN]

the others.[AN]

Listen,[.4] we don't have time for jokes.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Yes,[.4] her forces are infiltrating[N]
the underground prison.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
What?[.6] This has got to be[N]
some sort of jape?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
No,[.4] sir.[.6] Aeteria has really sent their[N]
crown princess,[.4] armed, to Wreyvine.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Is it?[.6] This is a war we're[N]
fighting,[.4] Your Highness.[AN]
And this is a battle to liberate[N]
Aeterian prisoners.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah,[.4] I guess[N]
you're right.[AN]
It's wishful thinking of mine to hope[N]
we could've settled this peacefully.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Huh?[.6] You know our options for peace[N]

[OpenMidRight]
Yo,[.4] bard. They let you keep[N]
your lute but not my tomes?[AN]
Hah,[.4] I actually[N]
feel cheated.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Well,[.4] s'not like I can kill[N]
someone with a lute.[AN]
That would damage this[N]
poor little thing[Beat][AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.4]

Have you tried crushing their skulls[N]
in with that thing?![AN]
Swing it like a warrior and[N]
land a critical blow!![AN]

[OpenFarFarRight][LoadSoldier][MoveMidRight]
Oi,[.4] pipe down,[N]
you two,[AN]
or we'll execute you[N]
on the spot![AN]
Imprisoning you two were quite difficult,[.4][N]
I'd be a shame to put it all to waste.[AN]

[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadVerna][MoveLeft]
Try it,[.4] dimwit![.6] I[N]
dare you![AN]
The only thing you're catching[N]
today are these fists![AN]
You hear me?![.6] I'll engulf you in[N]

How did you even get stuck[N]
