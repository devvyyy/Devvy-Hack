So[Beat] you going to get me out?[AN][Clear]
Who even are you guys[Beat][AN]

[MR][MoveRight][FR][LoadYufka][FR]
We are members of the Noctum Order[,][N]
a humble group of magi freedom fighters[N]
exiled from the Imperial Court.[AN]
We aim to liberate Aeteria from the unjust grasp[N]
of Duke Selwyn and Apostle Sylveria before[N]
Aeteria falls to ruin.[AN]
They are busy fighting wars in another country[N]
for conquest and retribution instead of[N]
tending to their own people.[AN]

[R][ClearFace][LoadYvonne]
With the Empress' untimely demise[,] Aeteria is[N]
in turmoil.[.6] Yet the Duke and Apostle do[N]
none for us![.6] We face woe and death![AN][ClearFace]

[R][LoadGraham]
We're looking for one who can lead our[N]
rebellion against Aeteria.[.6] Am I right to presume[N]
You are esteemed in the Resistance army?[AN]
Now[,] O heir... Would you join us[,] or[N]
would you rather rot in this cell until[N]
your execution date?[AN][Clear]
[Pause]That was called a [OpenQuote]joke"[,] as they say.[AN]

[R]
But we WOULD appreciate it if you joined us.[6N]
We have great food[,] very reasonable people[,][N]
absolutely perfect mentors[,] etcetera.[AN]

[FR]
Please say yes![.6] We actually came here with[N]
the assumption you would say yes![AN][ClearFace][LoadYufka]

[ML]
(It doesn't seem like I have a choice... These guys are my best bet if Radcliffe and co. aren't able to come here and break me out...)
Alright, I see. I'll fight for your cause. What role do I play in your silly little game?

[FR]
We want you to headline the combined liberation army of the Resistance and our Noctum Order. Will you ally with us?

[ML][MoveLeft][L]
You want me to lead two separate armies? I'm a soldier.[.6] I follow orders[,] not give them!

[R]
It is more like one big combined army. Tell me: who is better to bring hope to Aeteria's people than the heir to Aeteria? As a mercenary, you know how to fight. I presume a noblewoman and leader such as yourself is relatively charismatic, etcetera. We ask again for you to spearhead the army.

[L]
[ToggleMouthMove](If I decline[,] I'll be stuck here.)[ToggleMouthMove]
Got it[,] uh[,] Reverend Graham.[6N]
I'll lead the Resistance army.[AN]

[R]
[ToggleSmile][Beat][AN][ClearFace][LoadJaye]

[R]
Well, that was easy. Let's hop to it, double time!

[FR]
It is certainly easier to recruit those arrested and branded traitors, days before execution. We should continue with that strategy.

[R][ClearFace][LoadYvonne]
I wouldn't call that a strategy, per se...

[FR][ClearFace][LoadPolly]
Can we please stop wasting time? We have to save Verna and the other one in the cells below before it is too late.

[L]
How did you guys even get in here?

[L][ClearFace][LoadJaye]
Blew up the guard, blew up the doors, blew up your cell. Any more questions, O leader?

[FR][ClearFace][LoadGraham][MoveLeft]
First things first. Let us all exit this prison floor. We must recruit all of the prisoners here and then proceed to a lower floor. But thanks to Jaye's... problem-solving, there are now Aeterian soldiers after us. May the glorious wings of the Silver Serpent bless us. We will make swift work of them. Is everyone ready to fight? Spells checked, heads working okay, etcetera?

[FR][ClearFace][LoadYvonne]
Ahahahahaha! The Aeterian soldiers will know not of what is coming!

I love your vibe, Yvonne! Let's give 'em hell!

Tell me about the prisoner here[,] Reverend.[6N]
I mean[,] is she really so dangerous[N]

[OpenMidRight]
Of course not.[.6] This was to send a harsh[N]

I would bet that Count Kyveli will be[N]

Scary stuff.[.6] I had no idea of all[N]

Of course[,] this will not go unnoticed.[6N]
The Emperor has already cursed the name[N]

noble blood with uncontrollable power.[AN]

a great tutor of the arcane.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Magic[,] huh?[.6] I'm not much versed in[N]

[OpenMidRight]
You sense the ether in the air too[,][N]

Ether is always in the air;[.4] magic[N]

your raw talent[Beat][AN]
But the novelty's run its[N]
course.[.6] Stand down or die.[AN][CF]

You[,] the quiet one[Beat][AN]

crimes you committed.[AN][CF]

[MR][Velius]
I was locked away for[N]
speaking the truth.[AN]
Do you not see that[N]
our leaders' actions[AN]
have cursed Ideon?[AN][CF]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x34][0x1]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x34][0x1]
What manner of monster[N]
are you[,] sellsword?[AN]
I knew I'd sensed some kind[N]
of arcane force within you[Beat][AN]
But the way you tear armor[N]
asunder like it's wax[Beat][AN][CF]

[MR][Frye]
That's a secret for me to keep[N]
and for you to worry about.[AN]

Maybe in the next life we can[N]
share a drink together, eh?[AN][CF]

[MR][Chiffon]
Did you say Hayes?[6N]
Tell me[,] where is he?![AN][CF]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x34][0x1]
You have more pressing[N]
matters to worry about.[AN]
Do not brush me aside like[N]
I am a common soldier![AN]
My magic will be more than[N]
enough to keep you at bay![AN][CF]
