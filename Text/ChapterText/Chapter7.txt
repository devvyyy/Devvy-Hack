[OpenFarLeft]
[Pause]The attack on Wreyvine's Pale[N]
Palace was but a few moons ago.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Yeah,[.4] you missed the part where I[N]
swooped in and took the Eye![AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Please stop.[.6] [Pause]Why do you do[N]
this to me,[.4] Aoife?[AN]

[OpenLeft]
You know what you need,[.4] Maynard?[.6][N]
Some excitement in your life![AN]
Like come on,[.4] live[N]
a little.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
We got what we wanted.[.6][N] There's[N]
nothing more to it,[.4] right?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Correct.[.6] All that remains is[N]
holding the Wreyvians off.[AN]
They will doubtless send forces to[N]
claim the Eye of Creation back.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Our captured remain in the Pale Palace,[.4][N]
but we cannot risk any more losses.[AN]

[OpenRight][Pause]Cannot risk any[N]
more losses?[AN]
These are our people; it's our[N]
duty to rescue them![AN]

[OpenLeft]
I'm sorry,[.4] princess Chiffon,[N]
the Aeterian army[N]
currently has more pressing[N]
matters to attend to.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Defending Aeteria is of upmost[N]
priority at the time.[AN]
As such, you,[.4] princess,[.4] must stay[N]
behind.[.6] Is that clear?[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Even so,[.4] the captives served Aeteria and[N]
achieved glory for the cause.[AN]
We will set out to rescue them[N]
later,[.4] alright?[AN]

[OpenFarRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][MoveRight]
Later[Beat]?[.6] I wasn't aware of the[N]
captives until today![AN]
Such a primitive mindset by[N]
Aeteria's own Trinity![AN]
We must go to Wreyvine and rescue[N]
them![.6] I'll go if I must.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
My apologies,[.4] but the Queen requires[N]
us to be elsewhere.[AN]
You too,[.4] princess.[.6] Your mother[N]
wants you to stay on guard nearby.[AN]
Aeter Citadel to the South is a small[N]
fortress that will need a defense.[AN]
It's the least risky position for[N]
you to defend it,[.4] princess.[AN]

[OpenRight]
But[Beat][AN]

[OpenLeft]
[Pause]Come on,[.4] does the heir to Aeteria[N]
dare to defy the crown?[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
[Beat][AN]

[OpenRight]
No,[.4] of course not.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Remember:[.4] you are the weapon that[N]
Aeteria needs.[AN]
The moon's glow slumbers[N]
within you,[.4] Chiffon.[AN]
The more you bleed,[.4] the more[N]
you shine.[AN]
Yet your time is not now.[.6] Stay[N]
on guard for Wreyvian soldiers.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
You have been assigned to guard[N]
Fort Aeter to the South.[AN]
It is of historical and devout[N]
importance.[AN]
I believe this is your chance[N]
to shine under the moon.[AN]

[OpenRight]
[Pause]Understood[Beat] I[Beat] I will[N]
not fail Aeteria.[AN][X]

## Ch7Opening1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadChiffon][OpenMidRight][LoadChiffon]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]Graham![.6] Why didn't you stick[N]
up for me?[AN]
We have to rescue those Aeterian[N]
prisoners.[AN]
What else was all of my training[N]
and preparation for?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Your training is in case you're[N]
in unexpected danger,[AN]
not for when you're blindly rushing[N]
into enemy territory.[AN]
I agree with the Trinity:[.4] Your actions[N]
are not worth the risk.[AN]
What would Aeteria do without its[N]
crown princess?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I dunno,[.4] just have the Trinity[N]
handle political stuff.[AN]
I barely contribute to politics,[.4] I'm[N]
pretty much an Aeterian soldier.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
To defy your mother would mean[N]
defying the Queen herself[Beat][AN]
The crown princess of Aeteria would[N]
be branded a traitor.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I know what I'm doing,[.4] Graham.[.6][N]
No one will know we went.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
You don't know what you're doing,[.4][N]
nor the consequences of your actions.[AN]
You cannot shirk the royal duties[N]
to which you were born.[AN]
Unless you have a plan,[.4] we will[N]
not proceed with this folly.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
[Pause]I have a plan.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]Alright,[.4] I'll humor[N]
you.[.6] Go.[AN][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidRight]
So we go to Wreyvine by boat,[N]
infiltrate the Pale Palace,[AN]
rescue the prisoners,[.4] and leave[N]
undetected.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]The Wreyvians realize we're good,[.4][N]
and the war ends![.6] Ta-da![AN][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidLeft]
You're very naive if you think your[N]
imaginary actions will end this war.[AN]
Actually,[.4] you're naive for also thinking[N]
the first part of your plan will work.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Those Aeterians are relying[N]
on us,[.4] Graham.[AN]
They need us in their hour[N]
of need[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Chiffon,[.4] you're persistent as always,[.4][N]
I'll give you that.[AN]
But resolve will not shield you from[N]
Wreyvine's famed spears and arrows.[AN] 

[OpenMidRight]
One chance.[.6] Please,[.4] Graham.[.6][N]
I'm not leaving until you agree.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Ugh,[.4] for-[AN]

[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
Please.[.6] Believe in the Dark Rider.[.6][N]
Isn't that what you always said?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
What?[.6] I[Beat] Fine.[.6] You win.[.6] I don't[N]
want to deal with this.[AN]
[Pause]Rally the others,[.4] Chiffon. We set[N]
off for Wreyvine's Pale Palace now.[AN]

[OpenRight][MoveRight]
[ToggleSmile]Yes![.6] I knew you'd see my[N]
side,[.4] Graham.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
I didn't[Beat] Nevermind.[AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Pause]So this is the Pale Palace[Beat][N]
Everything is so[Beat] silver[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidRight]
The other retainers have scouted[N]
up ahead.[AN]
There's an underground passage[N]
leading to the prisons.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Whew,[.4] this is intense.[.6] I'm[N]
not sure if I'm ready.[AN]

It's now or never,[.4][N]
Chiffon.[AN]
We cannot let fear entrap[N]
us in the dark.[AN]
When we enter this door,[.4] we will[N]
walk towards bloodshed.[AN]

[Pause]I believe the Dark Rider will[N]
see us through.[AN]

Everyone in this group would-[.4] will sacrifice[N]
their life in exchange for yours.[AN]
You must be ready.[.6] The others[N]
are waiting for us inside.[A][X]

## Ch7Opening3

[OpenRight]
Hm?[.6] Oh,[.4] I'm glad you're[n]
finally here,[.4] princess Chiffon.[AN]
[Pause][MidBlink]And it looks like we got Graham[N]
too,[.4] of course.[AN][OpenEyes]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]Ah[Beat]![.6] Frye,[.4] you scared me[N]
with that fire sword of yours[Beat][AN]
[Pause]You using it as a torch or[N]
something?[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
All right,[.4] this should be[N]
simple enough.[AN]
Just in-and-out,[.4][N]
quick and easy.[.6][N]
We'll be back at the capital[N]
by ship soon enough.[N]

[OpenRight]
That's way more idealistic than I was[N]
expecting from you,[.4] Cortado.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
I sure hope this will be[N]
quick and easy[Beat][AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
There is no room in your heart[N]
for doubts now.[AN][ClearFace]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadWilken]
I tend to avoid problematic situations,[.4][N]
but I guess we're too far in,[.4] huh?[AN]

[OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadJaye][OpenLeft][MoveLeft]
Sweet,[.4] we're all here![.6][N]

[CloseEyes][MoveMidLeft]This is bad[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]

[OpenMidRight]
I think the contrary,[.4][N]
Your Highness.[AN]
The heavens turn towards the night[N]
with darkness,[.4] Chiffon.[AN]
Our faith will be tested.[.6] Now is[N]
our time to strike.[AN]

leave no survivors.[AN]

their silence.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Pause]Did you say the Aeterian[N]
princess?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Yes,[.4] her forces are infiltrating[N]
the underground prison.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
This has got to be[N]
some sort of joke?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
No,[.4] sir.[.6] Aeteria has really sent[N]
their crown princess,[.4] armed, to Wreyvine.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
This is[Beat] absurd.[.6] Everyone,[.4] move out.[.6][N]
This will certainly be[Beat] interesting.[A][X]

## Ch7ChiffonGrahamTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadChiffon][OpenMidRight][LoadGraham]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't feel ready for[N]
this,[.4] Graham[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidRight]
This was your idea and choice,[.4] do you[N]
see now the reality of battle?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]I know[Beat] but my axe[N]
arm feels[Beat] uneasy.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
You are the light the people look[N]
up to when the night is upon us.[AN]
Remember what you have learned:[.6] every[N]
slash,[.4] every step.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
It's not that I'm worried about[N]
my abilities[Beat][AN]
I don't feel like[Beat] cutting[N]
people down.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
If we do nothing,[.4] the Wreyvians will[N]
cast us back into the shadows.[AN]
Another rebirth of Ideon will[N]
sear into the soil.[AN]
Chiffon,[.4] you are the weapon our[N]
kingdom needs.[AN]
You must make a life of death, be the[N]
crest of our faith.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
A crest of our faith[Beat]?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
It's a terrifying first step,[.4][N]
princess.[AN]

But it is a necessary one: Aeteria's[N]
future rests on all of us.[AN]
When your steps falter,[.4] follow[N]
us.[.6] Keep your faith with each step[Beat][AN]
You chose this path,[.4] now see[N]
it through to the end.[AN]

get in here?[AN]
Weren't the doors locked?[.6] Was it[N]
left unguarded?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Blew the door open,[.4] blasted the[N]
the guy to ashes.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Huh,[.4] that's a bit[N]
much,[.4] don't you think?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Is it?[.6] This is a war we're[N]
fighting,[.4] Your Highness.[AN]
And this is a battle to liberate[N]
Aeterian prisoners.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah,[.4] I guess[N]
you're right.[AN]
It's wishful thinking of mine to hope[N]
we could've settled this peacefully.[AN]

You're staring into space.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Yes,[.4] Frye.[.6] I can't seem to[N]
focus on the battle at hand.[AN]
I[Beat] don't want to lose[N]
control again.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Hah,[.4] bold talk for someone[N]
without a flaming sword.[AN]
Actually,[.4] lose[Beat] control?[.6] Why,[.4] that's[N]
certainly ominous.[.6] Care to elaborate?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
A force slumbers in my[N]
royal blood.[AN]
It runs in the royal family[N]
of Aeteria.[AN]
It evokes the power of[N]
the moon's pale glow;[AN]
the Dark Rider's golden[N]
light-[.4] His eyes.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I've read that descendants of Wreyvine's[N]
Hallowed King have a similar silver light.[AN]
So what happens when your blood[N]
awakens,[.4] Your Highness?[AN]
Seems like something of legends,[.4][N]
a tavern tale.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Pause]If my blood awakens,[.4] Frye,[.4] none of our[N]
enemies will live to tell such tales.[AN][X]
