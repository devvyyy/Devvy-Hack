Alright[Beat] I'm not dreaming.[.6] Who are you?[6N]
Aren't you all part of the Aeterian army?[6N]
You're not supposed to be here[Beat][AN]
Unless you're all here to execute me?[6N]
Is that it?[.6] Aeteria does group executions now?[AN]

[FR]
Assuming we are here for execution?[.6] This one[N]
seems incredibly rude.[.6] Do we have to save her?[6N]
Her[Beat] vibes aren't it.[AN]

Now[,] now[,] Polly.[.6] The Order's mission is to[N]
recruit as many trustworthy adversaries who will[N]

I'd say the hair is a major spoiler alert.[6N]

you're Aeterian royalty[Beat]I mean[,] we also got a[N]

[R][ClearFace][LoadYufka]
I mentioned that the Empress had a third heir[N]

[FR]
Eh[,] semantics demantics.[.6] Yufka, I think you're[N]

[R][ClearFace][LoadGraham]
Anyway.[.6] One myth I'm particularly a fan of is the[N]
history of Ideon[Beat] the Four Champions of[N]

I'm not well-versed in that type of stuff.[AN]

[R]
Well[,] you ought to read people through history.[6N]
You learn that history always repeats itself[,] and[N]
the people are the same.[AN]
Take a lookie here at Polly:[.4] she is one like the[Beat][N]
Swordsman of Ideonian legend.[.6] Brooding[,] strong[,][N]

[ML]

Are you gonna break me out or not?[AN]

[MR]
Weak[,] yet with unmatched power[,] just waiting[N]
to be unleashed.[.6] I presume you are affiliated[N]

[ML]
Uh-huh[,] I was a hired merc before I was[N]
captured by this sleepy-looking guy.[6N]
So[Beat] you going to get me out?[AN][Clear]
Who even are you guys[Beat][AN]

[MR][MoveRight][FR][LoadYufka][FR]
We are members of the Noctum Order[,][N]
a humble group of magi freedom fighters[N]
exiled from the Imperial Court.[AN]
We aim to liberate Aeteria from the unjust grasp[N]
of Duke Selwyn and Apostle Sylveria before[N]
Aeteria falls to ruin.[AN]
They are busy fighting wars in another country[N]
for conquest and retribution instead of[N]
tending to their own people.[AN]

[R][ClearFace][LoadYvonne]
With the Empress' untimely demise[,] Aeteria is[N]
in turmoil.[.6] Yet the Duke and Apostle do[N]
none for us![.6] We face woe and death![AN][ClearFace]

[R][LoadGraham]
We're looking for one who can lead our[N]
rebellion against Aeteria.[.6] Am I right to presume[N]
You are esteemed in the Resistance army?[AN]
Now[,] O heir... Would you join us[,] or[N]
would you rather rot in this cell until[N]
your execution date?[AN][Clear]
[Pause]That was called a [OpenQuote]joke"[,] as they say.[AN]

[FR]
Graham.[AN]

[R]
But we WOULD appreciate it if you joined us.[6N]
We have great food[,] very reasonable people[,][N]
absolutely perfect mentors[,] etcetera.[AN]

[FR]
Please say yes![.6] We actually came here with[N]
the assumption you would say yes![AN][ClearFace][LoadYufka]

[ML]
(It doesn't seem like I have a choice... These guys are my best bet if Radcliffe and co. aren't able to come here and break me out...)
Alright, I see. I'll fight for your cause. What role do I play in your silly little game?

[FR]
We want you to headline the combined liberation army of the Resistance and our Noctum Order. Will you ally with us?

[ML][MoveLeft][L]
You want me to lead two separate armies? I'm a soldier.[.6] I follow orders[,] not give them!

[R]
It is more like one big combined army. Tell me: who is better to bring hope to Aeteria's people than the heir to Aeteria? As a mercenary, you know how to fight. I presume a noblewoman and leader such as yourself is relatively charismatic, etcetera. We ask again for you to spearhead the army.

[L]
[ToggleMouthMove](If I decline[,] I'll be stuck here.)[ToggleMouthMove]
Got it[,] uh[,] Reverend Graham.[6N]
I'll lead the Resistance army.[AN]

[R]
[ToggleSmile][Beat][AN][ClearFace][LoadJaye]

[R]
Well, that was easy. Let's hop to it, double time!

[FR]
It is certainly easier to recruit those arrested and branded traitors, days before execution. We should continue with that strategy.

[R][ClearFace][LoadYvonne]
I wouldn't call that a strategy, per se...

[FR][ClearFace][LoadPolly]
Can we please stop wasting time? We have to save Verna and the other one in the cells below before it is too late.

[L]
How did you guys even get in here?

[L][ClearFace][LoadJaye]
Blew up the guard, blew up the doors, blew up your cell. Any more questions, O leader?

[FR][ClearFace][LoadGraham][MoveLeft]
First things first. Let us all exit this prison floor. We must recruit all of the prisoners here and then proceed to a lower floor. But thanks to Jaye's... problem-solving, there are now Aeterian soldiers after us. May the glorious wings of the Silver Serpent bless us. We will make swift work of them. Is everyone ready to fight? Spells checked, heads working okay, etcetera?

[FR][ClearFace][LoadYvonne]
Ahahahahaha! The Aeterian soldiers will know not of what is coming!

[R][ClearFace][LoadJaye]
I love your vibe, Yvonne! Let's give 'em hell!

[R][ClearFace][LoadPolly]
...I am tired, honestly... May I take a nap after this?
