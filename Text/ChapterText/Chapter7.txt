[OpenRight][LoadMaynard]
[OpenFarFarLeft][Pause]It was really that[N]
simple?[.6][N]
Are you sure you didn't bring[N]
back a forgery of the Eye?[AN]

[OpenFarRight][MoveRight]
[ToggleSmile]Look for yourself,[.4][N] Your Highest[N]
of Highnesses![AN][ToggleSmile]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
Oho![.6] That is most impressive.[.6][N]
As expected from one of the Trinity.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]What are you going to[N]
do with it?[AN]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
Good question.[.6] I[Beat] wasn't expecting[N]
you to seize it so quickly,[.4] Aoife.[AN]
I suppose I will safeguard it[N]
in the royal chambers.[AN]
Until the time is right,[.4][N]
anyways.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]Hm.[.6] That's that,[.4][N]
then.[AN]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
Halt.[.6] There's one more thing[N]
I need to speak to you about.[AN]

[OpenRight]
Can it wait?[.6] I need my[N]
morning cup of-[AN]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
The Dark Rider will make[N]
her return.[AN]
A suitable vessel has appeared[N]
northside.[AN]
Yet to the north,[.4] the Holy King found[N]
a vessel somewhere in Wreyvine.[AN]

[OpenRight]
And what will happen,[.4][N]
Your Majesty?[AN]

[OpenFarFarLeft]With the return of both[N]
deities,[.4] the balance shifts.[AN]
Their vessels are the only ones who[N]
can use Ideon's twin treasures.[AN]
We're no longer in the brink of war.[.6] We[N]
cannot let them have either treasure.[A][X]

## Ch7Opening2
[OpenMidRight]
Try this![AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
That was close![AN]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadChiffon][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft][Pause]But I am getting[N]
better,[.4] right?[AN]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFrye]
Depends,[.4] princess.[.6] You really need[N]
to work on your offense.[N]
Er,[.4] instead of parrying[N]
every blow[Beat][AN]

Defense is the best[N]
offense,[.4] Frye.[AN]
And plus,[.4] I'll never have to[N]
use this stuff anyways.[AN]

Princess Chiffon.[.6] Need I remind you[N]
that we are in the midst of war.[AN]
If we were to fall,[.4] you need[N]
to protect yourself.[AN]

Eh,[.4] you all can handle[N]
yourselves fine.[AN]

Hey,[.4] did you see something[N]
enter the castle?[N]

No.[.6] Probably a wild fox[N]
or something.[.6] I'll check![A][X]

## Ch7Opening3
[Pause]![AN]

I'm very sorry,[.4] princess.[.6] But[N]
I can't let you leave.[AN]

What is the meaning of[N]
this,[.4] Eustace?[AN]

If we want to win this war,[.4][N]
we need access to the lost souls.[AN]
With both heirlooms and soldiers of[N]
moonlight,[.4] it's a sure victory.[AN]
And you don't don't seem to[N]
take the idea very well.[AN]

Lost[Beat] souls?[.6] The shadow[N]
soldiers?[AN]
Those are foul,[.4] Eustace[Beat][N]
And you know that.[AN]

It is necessary.[.6] I'm truly[N]
sorry,[.4] princess.[AN]

What are you going to do,[.4][N]
kill me in my own castle?[AN]

Correct.[AN]

Hey,[.4] wait![AN]

It's the shadow[Beat] things I[N]
saw last night[Beat][AN]
Stay back,[.4] everyone.[.6][N]
I'll take care of this.[AN]

## AoifeNoWay
Lady Aoife,[.4] would you like[N]
tea and cookies with your letter?[AN]
Ahem,[.4] They're biscuits,[.4] dear.[AN]
