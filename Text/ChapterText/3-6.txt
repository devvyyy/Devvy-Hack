[ML][Chiffon][MR][Graham]

[ML]
So this is it[,] huh?[.6] Burn the old banners and[N]
take down what's left of my family.[6N]
For Aeteria's new dawn.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[ML]
I still don't like it[,] even if I never[N]
really knew them.[AN]

[MR]
It must be done[,] Your Highness.[AN]

[ML]
I know.[.6] But it must be easy for you to say[,][N]
Reverend.[.6] Not like you've ever had to do[N]
anything like that.[AN]

[MR]
So it seems.[AN]

[ML]
[Beat]Am I wrong?[AN]

[MR]
Blood loyalty means little if the blood[N]
runs poison.[.6] Surely you've seen that[N]
by now[,] Your Highness.[AN]

[ML]
You're dodging again[,] Reverend.[AN]

[Event]

[MR]
I once stood beside a man who burned[N]
everything to the ground for[N]
his ideals.[AN]
I simply watched him while he tore pages[N]
from his past--[.4]burned homes and lied to[N]
the only people who trusted him.[AN]
Yet the Order now flourishes due to[N]
his influence.[.6] We are getting ever closer[N]
to the Emperor.[AN]

[ML]
Heh.[.6] So your Order wasn't just [OpenQuote]magi freedom[N]
fighters" after all.[.6] Not even the Minister could[N]
fool me with that one.[AN]

[MR]
That was the story I told you[,] yes.[AN]
Because if I had said[,] [OpenQuote]We were an unsanctioned[N]
counter-imperial enforcement group operating[N]
beneath the Emperor's gaze,"[AN]
you may have hesitated[,] Your Highness.[AN]

[ML]
I suppose that's fair.[.6] Your story about[N]
the Order changes every time.[.6] Is there[N]
any truth to what you've told me?[AN]

[MR]
We are many things[,] depending on who is[N]
writing the history[,] but yes.[6N]
The Order is a pillar lead by three.[AN]

[ML]
Wait[,] there's the Minister and then[N]
there's you.[.6] Who's the third?[AN]

[MR]
Lord Mariya was the Governor of the Order.[.6][N]
The name means little to you now[,] but he was[N]
the cornerstone of the Order's creation.[AN]

[ML]
You and the rest of the Order keep mentioning[N]
this guy.[.6] But[Beat] That Mariya?[.6] The statesman[N]
who does boring ol' speeches and stuff?[AN][C]
That guy really lead your Order?[AN]

[MR]
Correct.[.6] He had[Beat] his faults.[.6] Ones[N]
that simply could not be reconciled with[N]
the Empire.[AN]

[ML]
Eh[,] I mean we don't either[,] Reverend.[6N]
Just means we gotta keep going.[AN]

[MR]
Of course[,] Your Highness.[.6] If you follow[N]
my guidance[,] I trust no battle will be[N]
impossible for us.[AN]

[ML]
So what happened to him?[6N]
The speech guy.[.6] What'd he do in the end?[AN]

[MR]
Hm.[.6] He died like a king and a coward[,][N]
in equal measure.[.6] He asked for forgiveness from[N]
people who could no longer give it.[AN][C]
And he left the rest of us unfinished[,][N]
and cleaning up his mess.[AN]

[ML]
[Beat]So you want me to finish the job.[AN]

[MR]
Lord Mariya was a deeply sentimental man.[.6N]
He built the Order to save what he could[N]
not bear to lose again.[AN]
If he were in my position[,] he would have said[,][N]
[OpenQuote]C'mon[,] Malcolm.[.6] Almost there![.6] Ain't a lotta[N]
work left 'til our dream's realized!"[AN]

[ML][Smile]
Haha![.6] That's what he sounded like?[6N]
Accent and all?[AN][Smile]

[MR][Smile]
Like a drunk merchant from the capital[N]
outskirts trying to haggle with Fate.[.6] He[N]
never was one for winning over destiny.[AN]
His accent was dreadful.[.6] The way he said [OpenQuote]court"[N]
always sounded like [OpenQuote]cawt."[.6] But gods[Beat][N]
he was brilliant.[.6] More than that.[AN][C]
[Pause]And he liked the sound of his own voice[N]
far too much to bear.[AN][Smile]

[ML]
So do you[,] Reverend.[AN]

[MR]
That may be true.[AN]

[ML]
Did you know I was the princess of Aeteria?[6N]
Is that why you broke me out?[AN]

[MR]
I did.[.6] I was told[,] years ago.[AN]

[ML]
What?[.6] How?[.6] Who told you?[AN]

[MR]
He did[,] a long time ago.[.6] He figured it out long[N]
before the rest of us.[.6] He never said a[N]
word besides[,] [OpenQuote]The heir is alive."[AN]

[ML]
So my fate was decided by some dead guy[Beat][N]
And you[,] Reverend[Beat]?[.6] Why are you still here?[N]
Why did you believe in me?[AN]

[MR]
Because you never wanted the throne.[6N]
That is why it belongs to you.[AN]

[ML]
Haha[,] that's a terrible qualification[N]
for the throne.[AN]

[MR]
The best kind[,] Your Highness.[6N]
You fought beside other rebels and[N]
mercenaries.[.6] People from all walks of life.[AN]
Now[,] you are even fighting with people[N]
from the kingdom that fought a war[N]
against your empire.[AN]
You know how to listen and fight and[N]
when to do each when it matters.[6N]
And more importantly[Beat][AN]
You will not be alone[,] Your Highness.[6N]
You have the guidance of all those[N]
who stood beside you.[AN]

[ML]
You never stop with the praise[,] Reverend.[.6][N]
Now[,] is that all?[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]And because he would've wanted me to[N]
see it through.[.6] That is all.[6N]
If there's one last note[,] Chiffon.[AN]
I have little worry that with the aid of[N]
your allies[,] you can lead this nation.[6N]
Know that you can trust in me.[AN]

[ML]
You know what I'm gonna say[,] Reverend.[6N]
I won't let you[,] or anybody else down.[AN]

[MR]
Moonlight guide us.[AN]

[ML][Chiffon][MR][Raial]

[ML]
So this is it[,] huh?[.6] Burn the old banners and[N]
take down what's left of my family.[6N]
For Aeteria's new dawn.[AN]

[MR]
Looks that way.[.6] Hell of a headline.[AN]

[ML]
I still don't like it[,] even if I never[N]
really knew them.[AN]

[MR]
You're allowed to not like it.[.6][N]
Doesn't mean you're wrong.[.6][N]
Hell[,] I'm not wild about it either.[AN]

[ML]
You ever have to do it?[.6] I mean[,] walk away[N]
from what you were born into?[AN]

[MR]
Yeah.[.6] Once[,] Chiff.[.6] When I was twelve[,] I walked[N]
out of a noble court and never looked back.[AN]

[ML]
Captain[Beat] You were nobility?[AN]

[Event]

[MR]
Something like that.[.6] My mother was some[N]
big shot in the Imperial army.[.6][N]
Whole bit.[.6] Nobility and all that stuff.[AN]
It kinda sucked.[AN]
I was supposed to marry some limp bastard[N]
from across the river to seal up some[N]
fancy Wreyvian trade deals or whatever.[AN]
Didn't like that future[,] heh.[.6] So y'know[N]
what I did?[.6] I hopped the garden wall with[N]
an axe and a decent deal of coins.[AN][C]
[Pause]Got mugged before nightfall.[.6] Woops.[AN]

[ML]
You're kidding.[AN]

[MR]
I wish.[.6] Guy took the coins but left[N]
the axe.[.6] Maybe it was mercy.[6N]
Anywho[,] then I formed the Resistance.[AN]

[ML]
Okay[,] wait.[.6] How does that lead to this?[6N]
You skipped over the entire story.[AN]

[MR]
It's a boring[,] long story.[.6] I ran into some[N]
orphans[,] gave them food[,] helped the townsfolk[N]
by fending off bandits[,] yada-yada-yada.[AN]
Did a lot of random jobs not worth repeating.[6N]
Then I stole enough from the Empire by twenty[N]
to form my own unit.[AN]
Ta-da[,] that's how I formed the Resistance.[6N]
Rest is random history they're gonna write[N]
wrong anyway.[AN]

[ML]
Sheesh[,] that's why those at Arma spoke so[N]
highly of you[,] huh?[AN]

[MR]
They exaggerated.[.6] If Graham was right about one[N]
thing[,] it's that people will follow[N]
whatever they want to believe in.[AN][C]
And now's your chance to be that thing[N]
people choose to follow[,] Chiff.[AN]

[ML]
Captain[Beat] What if I'm not ready for this?[AN]

[MR]
You weren't born to lead[,] y'know.[.6][N]
Nobody is.[.6] But we're still here[,] and we[N]
have a damned war to win[,] yeah?[AN]
You and I kept showing up.[.6] That's what[N]
leadership is half the time.[.6][N]
Show up[,] take the hit first,[AN]
and always stand back up.[AN]

[ML]
You think I can do that?[.6] If we disregard[N]
the bloodline thing[,] I'm not much for nobility.[6N]
I was just some tavern rat.[AN]

[MR]
Good.[.6] The last thing we need is more[N]
[OpenQuote]throne people."[.6] We need someone who knows[N]
what it costs to survive,[AN]
like you and me.[AN]
You think my Resistance followed me[N]
because I had lofty ideals and an[N]
exaggerated sense of self-righteousness?[AN]
Nah[,] they followed me because I never[N]
stopped choosing them and knew when to[N]
make the right call.[AN]

[ML]
You're a leader who gave hope to those[N]
with none[,] Captain.[.6] But I don't have[N]
some[Beat] grand plan.[AN]

[MR]
Too late.[.6] You don't need one.[.6][N]
Look at you.[.6] You've fought beside[N]
rebels[,] cultists,[AN]
defended villages[,] even kept the Order and[N]
Resistance from stabbing each other.[6N]
That's a miracle on its own.[AN]
Your blood doesn't matter[,] just take the[N]
magical powers and claim your throne.[6N]
We'll always be by your side.[AN]

[ML]
Heh[,] I know that part.[.6] You know what?[.6] Once[N]
this war's over[,] I'll name a holiday after[N]
you[,] Captain.[AN]

[MR][MoveMR]
Hah![.6] Raial Day?[.6] That sounds terrible[,] gods[Beat][N]
If you did that[,] I'd strike out every time[N]
that day came.[.6] And I'd punch you.[AN]

[ML]
Jokes aside[,] thanks.[.6] I mean it[,] Captain.[6N]
This rebellion would've never gotten as far[N]
as it has without you and the others.[AN]

[MR]
Don't get sappy on me now.[.6] Save it for the[N]
after-party.[.6] And if--[.4]nah[,] WHEN we do win--[.4][N]
I'll make sure you never forget it.[AN][C]
[Beat]Now come on[,] *Your Highness*.[.6][N]
We've got a war to win.[AN]

[ML]
Lieutenant[,] a quick word with you.[AN]

[MR]
Of course[,] Affogato.[.6] It's rare that you of[N]
all people want to chat.[.6] Is something[N]
the matter?[AN]

[ML]
You knew[,] didn't you?[.6] Before I spoke to[N]
you at the riverside.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]Yes.[.6] I did.[6N]
Heh.[.6] You've got that look again.[AN]

[ML]
You never stopped believing in me[,] and[N]
I don't understand.[.6] Anatolius died because[N]
of me[,] but you didn't cast me out.[AN]

[MR]
I knew how it would go.[.6] I was prepared[N]
all my life to meet the same fate.[6N]
But I always knew you'd come back.[AN]

[ML]
I see.[.6] Sometimes I think that maybe I could've[N]
or should've died when the King did.[6N]
That would've been cleaner.[AN]

[MR]
Yeah[,] maybe.[.6] But nothing about this is clean.[6N]
None of us survived by being clean with[N]
kingdom or empire.[AN]

[ML]
I never expected to be on this side[N]
of the bridge again.[.6] We never really[N]
crossed it properly in the first place.[AN]

[MR]
Well[,] that's Fate for you.[.6] Isn't that funny?[.6][N]
Two Imperials turned bluescarves[,] now on their[N]
merry way to sever the Emperor's head.[AN]
I guess I'm even more foolish for never[N]
giving up on you[,] but I don't regret[N]
it for a second.[AN]

[ML]
Well[,] that's the road towards absolution.[6N]
I suppose I just want to stand where I[N]
should've from the start.[AN]
This redemption is[Beat] the one thing I'm[N]
grateful for.[.6] To be able to fight[N]
with the 7th Platoon again.[AN][C][Smile]
I'm happy.[AN][Smile]

[MR]
Let's see this through to the end[,] Affogato.[6N]
One final time before it's over.[AN]

[3L]
[ML][Selwyn2][MR][Warden]

[ML]
How has it has only been seven moons?[6N]
Fate truly never stops the wheel of time.[6N]
And you[,] my great Warden[Beat][AN]

[MR]
My Emperor.[AN]

[ML]
You were not present at the earliest battles[N]
in the kingdom[,] correct?[AN]

[MR]
Nay[,] my Emperor.[AN]

[ML]
I stood at the Wreyvian capital city.[6N]
I was[Beat] nervous.[.6] I thought my heart would[N]
seize[,] and flee from my chest.[AN]
I had never addressed so many soldiers[N]
at once.[.6] Never before had I needed them[N]
to believe in me.[AN]
They were to fight and[Beat] die for me.[6N]
All I wanted to do at that moment was[N]
run[,] far far away.[AN]

[CSS][.6]

[ML]
I remember the soldiers' faces.[6N]
Men from the shoreside, from the crown city[,][N]
even a few farmers from the quarries.[AN]
All staring at me like I was a god.[6N]
And all because I gave them a face[N]
to blame:[.4] King Anatolius of Wreyvine.[AN][C]
I never gave the order[,] yet[,] even so[Beat][N]
They all kneeled to me.[AN]

[MR]
Anatolius never knelt.[AN]

[ML]
I let the King of Wreyvine kneel in his own[N]
blood by sunrise.[.6] The war finally began when[N]
when Anatolius stood still.[AN]

[MR]
You led them well.[.6] And now[,] the war will[N]
soon come to a close.[AN]

[ML]
No[,] I was not yet a leader fit for the[N]
people.[.6] There was one[,] at Northelm[Beat][N]
A young man about my age[,] I presume.[AN]
I found him standing even after the crowd[N]
around him dispersed.[.6] I thought he[N]
missed his home[,] much like I.[AN]
[Pause]But he struck quickly.[.6] The dagger cut[N]
through and narrowly missed my heart.[6N]
The man escaped soon after.[AN]

[MR]
You were unguarded.[AN]

[ML]
Yes[,] I deserved such a mark for my naivete[N]
and inability to protect myself.[.6] How could[N]
I have hoped to lead a nation?[AN]
And then you[Beat] A masked Warden who routed[N]
a dozen rebel incursions before she even[N]
spoke her name.[AN]
You didn't exist[,] and suddenly[,] you commanded[N]
half my legion.[.6] The arcane is truly capable[N]
of such terrifying feats.[AN]

[MR]
I answered only to destiny's call.[.6][N]
That is all[,] my Emperor.[AN]

[ML]
Of course[,] but you did not arrive for me[,][N]
Warden.[.6] You arrived for her.[.6] The[N]
Liberation's little heir.[AN][C]
The girl who came back.[AN]

[MR]
You fear her.[.6] I have seen that suspicion[N]
before.[.6] Her powers and all it entails[Beat][N]
it drives fear into the coldest hearts.[AN]

[ML]
I watched a thousand fires bloom in[N]
one night.[.6] Our forces surged across[n]
the kingdom[,] much like the old war.[AN]
In just a few moons[,] Wreyvine was under[N]
my boots.[.6] Not even the Serpent herself[N]
could save the people then.[AN]
Yet the rebellion[Beat] It then took root[N]
in our empire.[.6] I did not understand such[N]
a war at the time.[AN][C]
I could not possibly comprehend how[N]
they ever started to[Beat] win.[AN]

[MR]
They are well-led[,] my Emperor.[6N]
That cannot be denied.[.6] Their leader is quite[N]
a stubborn pup.[6N][AN]

[ML]
Their leader is my[Beat] half-sister[Beat][N]
And now[,] we stand at the mercy of that[N]
same girl--[.4]your little light.[AN]
The rebels breach the Triarc;[.4] they seek the[N]
Bastion[,] the throne[,] and my life.[.6] I fear[N]
even you cannot thwart my fate.[AN]
[Pause]But I have accepted it long ago.[6N]
What I wonder now[,] still[,] is if you are[N]
prepared to face the head of their army.[AN]

[MR]
I have buried many names[,] my Emperor.[.6][N]
The one I wear now is not the first[,][N]
and it will not be the last.[AN][C]
I am prepared[,] my Emperor.[AN]

[ML]
I never doubted you[,] yet if I was in your[N]
position[Beat] I would shatter knowing[N]
who leads them.[AN]
They said you appeared one day from the[N]
northern lights.[.6] Does the light in her eyes not[N]
remind you of an old[,] forgotten dawn?[AN]
Will you be able to face her once more[,][N]
Warden?[.6] Or perhaps there still lies a soul[N]
beneath that obsidian heart?[AN]

[MR]
My duty is to the crown[,] now and always.[.6][N]
But do understand that Fate is ever[N]
the mercurial one.[AN]

[ML]
Oh[,] how immutable Fate dances in circles.[6N]
The girl who was thrown from the palace now[N]
comes back wearing her mother's cloak.[AN]
It is strange[,] however[Beat] After all this[N]
blood and banners[,] I still dream of[N]
that soldier.[AN]
The hooded knave who haunts my dreams[Beat][N]
the one who bears the Harbinger's mark[Beat][N]
The black knife remains my nemesis.[AN]

[MR]
The light of judgement is approaching[,][N]
my Emperor.[.6] Allow me to become your sword[N]
and shield.[AN]
You know there are no other options;[.4][N]
you must keep fighting to the end.[.6][N]
Come what may[,] you mustn't give up.[AN]

Then there isn't any more time to waste.[6N]
