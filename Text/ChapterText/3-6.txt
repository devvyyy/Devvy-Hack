[ML][Chiffon][MR][Graham]

[ML]
So this is it[,] huh?[.6] Burn the old banners and[N]
take down what's left of my family.[6N]
For Aeteria's new dawn.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[ML]
I still don't like it[,] even if I never[N]
really knew them.[AN]

[MR]
It must be done[,] Your Highness.[AN]

[ML]
I know.[.6] But it must be easy for you to say[,][N]
Reverend.[.6] Not like you've ever had to do[N]
anything like that.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[ML]
[Beat]Am I wrong?[AN]

[MR]
Blood loyalty means little if the blood[N]
runs poison.[.6] Surely you've seen that[N]
by now[,] Your Highness.[AN]

[ML]
You're dodging again[,] Reverend.[AN]

[MR]
I once stood beside a man who burned[N]
everything to the ground for[N]
his ideals.[AN]
I simply watched him while he tore pages[N]
from his past--[.4]burned homes and lied to[N]
the only people who trusted him.[AN]
Yet the Order now flourishes due to[N]
his influence.[.6] We are getting ever closer[N]
to the Emperor.[AN]

[ML]
Heh.[.6] So your Order wasn't just [OpenQuote]magi freedom[N]
fighters" after all.[.6] Not even the Minister could[N]
fool me with that one.[AN]

[MR]
That was the story I told you[,] yes.[AN]
Because if I had said[,] [OpenQuote]We were an unsanctioned[N]
counter-imperial enforcement group operating[N]
beneath the Emperor's gaze,"[AN]
you may have hesitated[,] Your Highness.[AN]

[ML]
I suppose that's fair.[.6] Your story about[N]
the Order changes every time.[.6] Is there[N]
any truth to what you've told me?[AN]

[MR]
We are many things[,] depending on who is[N]
writing the history[,] but yes.[6N]
The Order is a pillar lead by three.[AN]

[ML]
Wait[,] there's the Minister and then[N]
there's you.[.6] Who's the third?[AN]

[MR]
Lord Mariya was the Governor of the Order.[.6][N]
The name means little to you now[,] but he was[N]
the cornerstone of the Order's creation.[AN]

[ML]
You and the rest of the Order keep mentioning[N]
this guy.[.6] But[Beat] That Mariya?[.6] The statesman[N]
who does boring ol' speeches and stuff?[AN][C]
That guy really lead your Order?[AN]

[MR]
Correct.[.6] He had[Beat] his faults.[.6] Ones[N]
that simply could not be reconciled with[N]
the Empire.[AN]

[ML]
Eh[,] I mean we don't either[,] Reverend.[6N]
Just means we gotta keep going.[AN]

[MR]
Of course[,] Your Highness.[.6] If you follow[N]
my guidance[,] I trust no battle will be[N]
impossible for us.[AN]

[ML]
So what happened to him?[6N]
The speech guy.[.6] What'd he do in the end?[AN]

[MR]
Hm.[.6] He died like a king and a coward[,][N]
in equal measure.[.6] He asked for forgiveness from[N]
people who could no longer give it.[AN][C]
And he left the rest of us unfinished[,][N]
and cleaning up his mess.[AN]

[ML]
[Beat]So you want me to finish the job.[AN]

[MR]
Lord Mariya was a deeply sentimental man.[.6N]
He built the Order to save what he couldn't[N]
bear to lose again.[AN]
If he were in my position[,] he would have said[,][N]
[OpenQuote]C'mon[,] Malcolm.[.6] Almost there![.6] Ain't a lotta[N]
work left 'til our dream's realized!"[AN]

[ML][Smile]
Haha![.6] That's what he sounded like?[6N]
Accent and all?[AN][Smile]

[MR][Smile]
Like a drunk merchant from Imperial outskirts[,][N]
trying to haggle with Fate.[.6] He never[N]
was one for destiny.[AN]
His accent was dreadful.[.6] The way he said “court”[N]
always sounded like “cawt.” But gods...[N]
he was brilliant.[AN][C]
[Pause]And he liked the sound of his own voice[N]
far too much to bear.[AN][Smile]

[ML]
So do you[,] Reverend.[AN]

[MR]
That may be true.[AN]

[ML]
Did you know I was the princess of Aeteria?[6N]
Is that why you broke me out?[AN]

[MR]
I did.[.6] I was told[,] years ago.[AN]

[ML]
What?[.6] How?[.6] Who told you?[AN]

[MR]
He did[,] a long time ago.[.6] He figured it out long[N]
before the rest of us.[.6] He never said a[N]
word besides[,] "the heir is alive."[AN]

[ML]
So my fate was decided by some dead guy[Beat][N]
And you[,] Reverend[Beat]?[.6] Why are you still here?[N]
Why did you believe in me?[AN]

[MR]
Because you never wanted the throne.[6N]
That is why it belongs to you.[AN]

[ML]
Haha[,] that's a terrible qualification[N]
for the throne.[AN]

[MR]
The best kind[,] Your Highness.[6N]
You fought beside other rebels and mercenaries.[6N]
People from all walks of life.[AN]
Now[,] you are even fighting with people[N]
from the kingdom that fought a war[N]
against your empire.[AN]
You know how to listen and fight.[6N]
When to do each when it matters.[6N]
And more importantly[Beat][AN]
You won't be alone[,] Your Highness.[6N]
You'll have the guidance of everyone[N]
who stood beside you.[AN]

[ML]
You never stop with the praise[,] Reverend.[.6][N]
Now[,] is that all?[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]And because he would've wanted me to[N]
see it through.[.6] That is all.[6N]
If there's one last note[,] Chiffon.[AN]
I have little worry that with the aid of[N]
your allies[,] you can lead this nation.[6N]
Know that you can trust in me.[AN]

[ML]
You know what I'm gonna say[,] Reverend.[6N]
I won't let you[,] or anybody else down.[AN]

[MR]
Moonlight guide us.[AN]

[ML][Chiffon][MR][Raial]

[ML]
So this is it[,] huh?[.6] Burn the old banners and[N]
take down what's left of my family.[6N]
For Aeteria's new dawn.[AN]

[MR]
Looks that way.[.6] Hell of a headline.[AN]

[ML]
I still don't like it[,] even if I never[N]
really knew them.[AN]

[MR]
You're allowed to not like it.[.6][N]
Doesn't mean you're wrong.[.6]
Hell[,] I'm not wild about it either.[AN]

[ML]
You ever have to do it?[.6] I mean[,] walk away[N]
from what you were born into?[AN]

[MR]
Yeah.[.6] Once[,] Chiff.[.6] When I was twelve[,] I walked[N]
out of a noble court and never looked back.[AN]

[ML]
Captain[Beat] You were nobility?[AN]

[MR]
Something like that.[.6] My mother was some big shot[N]
in the Imperial army.[.6] Whole bit.[.6] I was supposed[N]
It kinda sucked.[AN]
I was supposed to marry some limp bastard from[N]
across the river to seal up some fancy[N]
Wreyvian trade deals or whatever.[AN]
Didn't like that future[,] heh.[.6] So y'know what[N]
I did?[.6] I hopped the garden wall with an axe[N]
and a decent deal of coins.[AN][C]
[Pause]Got mugged before nightfall.[.6] Woops.[AN]

[ML]
You're kidding.[AN]

[MR]
I wish.[.6] Guy took the coins but left[N]
the axe.[.6] Maybe it was mercy.[6N]
Anywho[,] then I formed the Resistance.[AN]

[ML]
Okay[,] wait.[.6] How do any of these even correlate[N]
to one another?[AN]

[MR]
It's a boring[,] long story.[.6] I ran into some[N]
orphans[,] gave them food[,] helped the townsfolk[N]
by fending off bandits[,] yada-yada-yada.[AN]
Did a lot of random jobs not worth repeating.[6N]
Then I stole enough from the empire by twenty[N]
to form my own unit.[AN]
Ta-da[,] that's how I formed the Resistance.[6N]
Rest is random history they're gonna write[N]
wrong anyway.[AN]

[ML]
Sheesh[,] that's why those at Arma spoke so[N]
highly of you[,] huh?[AN]

[MR]
They exaggerated.[.6] If Graham was right about one[N]
thing[,] it's that people will follow whatever[N]
they want to believe in.[AN][C]
And now's your chance to be that thing[N]
people choose to follow[,] Chiff.[AN]

[ML]
Captain[Beat] What if I'm not ready for this?[AN]

[MR]
You weren't born to lead[,] y'know.[.6] Nobody is.[6N]
But we're still here[,] and we have a damned[N]
war to win[,] yeah?[AN]
You and I kept showing up.[.6] That's what leadership is[,][N]
half the time.[.6] Show up[,] take the hit first[,][N]
and always stand back up.[AN]

[ML]
You think I can do that?[.6] If we disregard[N]
the bloodline thing[,] I'm not much for nobility.[6N]
I was just some tavern rat.[AN]

[MR]
Good.[.6] The last thing we need is more [OpenQuote]throne people."[.6]
We need someone who knows what it costs[N]
to survive[,] like you and me.[AN]
You think my Resistance followed me because[N]
I had lofty ideals and an exaggerated sense[N]
of self-righteousness?[AN]
Nah[,] they followed me because I never[N]
stopped choosing them and knew when to[N]
make the right call.[AN]

[ML]
But I don't have some grand plan.[AN]

[MR]
Too late.[.6] You don't need one.[.6] Look at you.[AN]
You've fought beside rebels[,] cultists[,][N]
defended villages[,] even kept the Order and Resistance[N]
from stabbing each other.[AN]
That's a miracle on its own.[AN]
Your blood doesn't matter[,] just take the[N]
magical powers and claim your throne.[6N]
We'll always be by your side.[AN]

[ML]
Heh[,] I know.[.6] I'll name a holiday after you[,] Captain.[AN]

[MR]
Haha![.6] Raial Day?[.6] That sounds terrible[,] gods[Beat][N]
If you did that[,] I'd strike out every time[N]
that day came.[AN]

[ML]
Jokes aside[,] thanks.[.6] I mean it[,] Captain.[6N]
This rebellion would've never gotten as far[N]
as it has without you and the others.[AN]

[MR]
Don't get sappy on me now.[.6] Save it for the after-party.[6N]
And if--[.4]nah[,] WHEN we do win--[.4]I'll make[N]
sure you never forget it.[AN][C]
[Beat]Now come on[,] *Your Highness*.[.6][N]
We've got a war to win.[AN]

The central keep[,] the Last Bastion lies[N]
