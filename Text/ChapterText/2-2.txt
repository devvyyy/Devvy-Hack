[MR]
I knew the empire's influence was immense[,][N]
but did they really take over the kingdom[N]
in just a few days?[AN]

[L]
In a way.[.6] The Duke was steadfast in his[N]
assault on the kingdom.[.6] He slayed the King[,][N]
in a historic battle[,] conquering Wreyvine.[AN][C]
In a few moons[,] the entire kingdom was[N]
subjugated under his flames.[AN]

[FL]
The Duke's grip will sink.[.6] It is impossible[N]
for him to maintain grasp on garrisoned[N]
territories with such threats of unrest.[AN]

[MR]
That's what you're planning to do with[N]
Aeteria[,] too[,] huh?[AN]

[L]
I hear rumors of a rising leader among the[N]
kingdom forces.[.6] They call him the[N]
Ashen Rider of the north.[AN]
I'm sure through word-of-mouth[,] the true[N]
tales have been diluted[,] so the finer[N]
points may be hazy.[AN]
But if this is true[,] this may be a boon[N]
yet for our battle against the empire.[6N]
I wonder if one like that truly exists.[AN]

[MR]
That just sounds like bunk to me.[.6][N]
Are you sure it's not just another[N]
Wreyvian folk tale?[AN]

[FL]
Whatever it is[,] I hope it does not get[N]
in our way.[.6] On to the topic at hand[,][N]
Arma is just a few days to the east.[AN]

[MR]
Arma[,] huh?[.6] I've never been good at reading[N]
maps[,] Minister[,] but I can't say I've[N]
heard of it.[AN]

[L]
Ser[,] you must have a short memory.[6N]
The town acts as our current hideout[,] away[N]
from the prying eyes of the imperial army.[AN]
The forests and mountains make for good[N]
cover against the wyverns of the empire[,][N]
and few maps have it etched.[AN]

[L]

such a haste[Beat] Is something the matter?[AN]

[FR]
I bring ill tidings[Beat] There are[Beat] monsters![6N]
Monsters at Arma![AN]

[FL]
Quick to act[,] I see[Beat] Verna[,] do we know what[N]
we find ourselves facing against?[.6] Aside from[N]
the monsters[,] any Imperial troops?[AN]

[MR]
No soldiers.[.6] It's a horde of faceless[,] formless[N]
creatures who fade into ashes.[.6] I can't tell[N]
you any more than that.[AN]

[L]
Whatever it is[,] we can fend them off with[N]
steel and spells[,] yeah?[.6] Then what're[N]
we waiting for?[AN]

[FL]
Do not cast judgment with rash decisions[,] Ser.[6N]

You really think that Order spy[N]

He seemed awful eager to volunteer to[N]
search for help[,] don't you think?[AN]

What choice do we have?[.6] He knows[N]
Graham better than we do.[.6] He can[N]
find the others quicker than us.[AN]

Hmph[,] to think we have to rely[N]
on the damn nobles to bail us out.[AN]

We've been tasked to take care of the[AN]

me spared.[AN][C]
Heh[,] I suppose I owe it to him that I'm[N]

What business could he possibly be here for?[N]
If he located the village[,] then we would[N]

Hey[,] I've got a question.[.6] One I don't[N]

[MR]
What's on your mind[,] Ser?[AN]

[ML]
You Noctum Order members are[N]
ex-Aeterian Court[,] right?[.6] Couldn't[N]
you have stopped this mess?[AN]

[MR]
It's more complex than that.[.6] We of the[N]
Noctum Order kept a close eye on[N]
Emperor Selwyn during his invasion.[AN]
We knew he was sharp and had[N]
potential for a prosperous reign[,] but[N]
his emotions easily swayed him.[AN]
By the end of the invasion[,] it was clear[N]
he was unfit to rule[,] but he caught[N]
wind of our plans against him.[AN]
He was the one who struck first.[6N]
We were publicly branded traitors and[N]
had no choice but to flee the court.[AN]

[ML]
Cast out of your own homes and labeled[N]
enemies of the state[,] huh?[.6] Harsh[,][N]
but given what I saw in that prison,[AN]
I'm unsurprised.[AN]

[MR]
Selwyn believes he has achieved[N]
his dreams--[.4]of avenging the late[N]
Empress and uniting Ideon.[AN]
Now he scrambles about like a[N]
child trying to keep the pieces[N]
from falling apart.[AN][C]
He overreacts to anything he sees[N]
as a threat to his great work.[AN]

[ML]
So he thinks he achieved something[N]
and doesn't want to lose that.[.6] Huh.[6N]
That makes a lot more sense.[AN]
Still[,] with any luck it won't be long[N]
before we can bring this country[N]
to a better state than it is in now.[AN]
Hopefully with you at the helm[N]
in a position of responsibility[N]
somewhere or another.[AN]
