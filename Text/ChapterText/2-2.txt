[MR]
I knew the empire's influence was immense[,][N]
but did they really take over the kingdom[N]
in just a few days?[AN]

[L]
In a way.[.6] The Duke was steadfast in his[N]
assault on the kingdom.[.6] He slayed the King[,][N]
in a historic battle[,] conquering Wreyvine.[AN]
In a few moons[,] the entire kingdom was[N]
subjugated under his flames.[AN]

[FL]
The Duke's grip will sink.[.6] It is impossible[N]
for him to maintain grasp on garrisoned[N]
territories with such threats of unrest.[AN]

[MR]
That's what you're planning to do with[N]
Aeteria[,] too[,] huh?[AN]

[L]
I hear rumors of a rising leader among the[N]
kingdom forces.[.6] They call him the[N]
Ashen Rider of the north.[AN]

[MR]
That just sounds like bunk to me.[.6][N]
Are you sure it's not just another[N]
Wreyvian folk tale?[AN]

[L]
Whatever it is[,] I hope it does not get[N]
in our way.[.6] On to the topic at hand[,][N]
Arma is just a few days to the east.[AN]

[MR]
Arma[,] huh?[.6] I've never been good at reading[N]
maps[,] Minister[,] but I can't say I've[N]
heard of it.[AN]

[L]
Ser[,] you must have a short memory.[6N]
The town acts as our current hideout[,] away[N]
from the prying eyes of the imperial army.[AN]
The forests and mountains make for good[N]
cover against the wyverns of the empire[,][N]
and few maps have it etched.[AN]

[FFR]
Hey!![AN][CSS][Event]

[MR][MoveRight]

[FFR][LoadGus][MoveFarRight]
Minister[,] Reverend[Beat] You've made it back[N]
in one piece![AN]

[L]
Gus[Beat] To think you would run to us in[N]
such a haste[Beat] Is something the matter?[AN]

[FR]
I bring ill tidings... There are... monsters![6N]
Monsters at Arma![AN]

[L]
That cannot be.[.6] Imperial soldiers have[N]
already found our hideout?[AN]

[FR]
No[,] Reverend[Beat] It's unexplainable.[.6][N]
Come with me![AN]

## Ch22Opening2

[FR]
I've located Captain Raial with her band[N]
of the Resistance.[.6] We need to hurry[,][N]
they look like they're in a pinch.[AN]

[L]
We'll help them out.[.6] C'mon![.6] Let's go[,][N]
everybody come with me![AN]

[FL]
Quick to act[,] I see[Beat] Verna[,] do we know what[N]
we find ourselves facing against?[.6] Aside from[N]
the monsters[,] any Imperial troops?[AN]

[MR]
No soldiers.[.6] It's a horde of faceless[,] formless[N]
creatures who fade into ashes.[.6] I can't tell[N]
you any more than that.[AN]

[L]
Whatever it is, we can fend them off with[N]
steel and spells, yeah?[.6] Then what're[N]
we waiting for?[AN]

[FL]
Do not cast judgment with rash decisions[,] Ser.[6N]
We have no knowledge of our enemies.[AN]

[L]
We have to act quickly before your allies[N]
are overtaken.[.6] Come on![AN]

Hah![.6] These things are getting kinda fun[N]

[FL]
Captain.[.6] Focus on survival![.6] The way these[N]
things fade when the arrow exits is[N]
so disquieting[Beat][AN]

[L][MoveLeft]
Ah[,] Serpent's tail![6N]
Mind your step[,] Rina![AN]

[FR]
I'm fine![.6] Why do you spend so much[N]
time worrying?[AN]

[R]
Those must be the fighters we're looking for.[6N]
Alright[,] let's move in![AN]

We have to get to them before the monsters[N]
do.[.6] I'll follow your lead[,] Ser.[.6][N]
I place my faith in you.[AN]

We're finally entering the end of the[N]

Winter won't let up and neither will[N]
the horde![AN]

[MR]
Captain Solum[Beat] Watch your neck.[6N]
Look at how those creatures[Beat] squirm.[AN]

[ML]
You talking about the mercs or the[N]
revenants they're after?[AN]

[MR]
Tsch[,] we don't have time for this.[6N]
If this is where the rebels are hiding[,][N]
then I got an idea.[AN][C]
I say we just light up the damn place[N]
and scram.[AN]

[FFR]
Now what is this I hear about lighting up?[AN]

This is where the rebels were last sighted.[N]
But by the Serpent[Beat] It looks like I've[N]
found myself a few strays.[AN]

[FR]
Huh?![.6] M-Major Hayes?![AN]

[R]
Hayes[,] you scoundrel![.6] What the hell are you[N]
doing here?![AN]

[ML][MoveLeft]
Tell me:[.4] who let treacherous curs like you two[N]
lead the search for the rebels?[.6] Two idiots[N]
on such an important mission[Beat] Unthinkable![AN]

[R]
Uh[Beat] G-[.4]General Messel[Beat] told us to[N]
f-[.4]find them[,] no matter the cost![AN]

[FR]
You see[,] Major Hayes[Beat] Opal and Wellington[N]
are on a fortifying mission at the crown city.[6N]
We've been tasked to take care of the[AN]
rebels ourselves.[AN]

[L]
And your brilliant solution is to light a[N]
village ablaze?![.6] Nay, that is a crime[N]
upon this empire.[AN]
I cannot let you return to base in anything[N]
but chains.[AN]

[R]
Like you're one to talk[,] Major![.6] Justice at[N]
any cost is your strategy in motion![AN]

[ML][LoadHaye][3L]
What a mess I've left behind[Beat][AN][C]
I suppose I must report back.[6N]
You rebels would be taken to the castle[N]
under less fortunate circumstances.[AN]
The next time our paths cross[,] my spear[N]
will find its target[,] and justice[N]
will be delivered.[AN]

[FR][LoadGraham]
Major General Haye of the imperial guard.[6N]
Ser, if I recall[,] you have prior history[N]
with him on the battlefield.[AN]

[R]
Yeah[,] I lost to him.[.6] He tried to push[N]
for my execution[,] but General Messel saw[N]
me spared.[AN]
Heh, I suppose I owe it to him that I'm[N]
still here.[AN]

[FR][LoadGraham]
What business could he possibly be here for?[N]
If he located the village[,] then we would[N]
best hurry.[AN]

[R]
Let's go.[.6] I'll find my chance to get even[N]
with Hayes later. Right now, we have to make sure[N]
the rest of the liberation army is okay.[AN]

In my pursuit of their whereabouts[,] I am led[N]
straight towards those I seek.[AN]

[Pause]Ah[,] the mercenary with strange powers.[6N]
For me to make so amateur a mistake.[6N]
And I thought I had you sent to Sele.[AN]

[MR]
Come at me[,] Hayes![.6] Let me leave a few[N]

That'd be nice[,] but we're not out unscathed.[6N]
But we can stand[,] and fight[,] if that[N]
matters to you.[AN]

Captain Raial of the Resistance[,] it's a[N]
pleasure to fight with you.[AN]

I'm a mercenary recruited by the Order.[AN]

[MR]
You're a real shot with those crossbows[N]

quite like you.[AN]
