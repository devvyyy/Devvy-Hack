[MR]
I knew the empire's influence was immense[,][N]
but did they really take over the kingdom[N]
in just a few days?[AN]

[L]
In a way.[.6] The Duke was steadfast in his attack[,][N]
and slayed the King[,] conquering Wreyvine.[6N]
In a few moons[,] the kingdom was under his heel.[AN]

[FL]
The Duke's grip is falling[,] I hear.[.6] He cannot[N]
keep his grasp on garrisoned territories[N]
due to violent rebellion.[AN]

[MR]
That's what you're planning to do with[N]
Aeteria[,] too.[AN]

[L]
I hear rumors of a rising leader among the
kingdom forces.[.6] They call him the[N]
ashen rider of the north.[AN]

[MR]
That just sounds like bunk to me.[.6] Are you[N]
sure it's not just another Wreyvian folk tale?[AN]

[L]
Whatever it is[,] I hope it does not get[N]
in our way.[.6] On to the topic at hand[,][N]
Arma is just a few days to the east.[AN]

[MR]
Never heard of it.[AN]

[MR]
Ser[,] you must have a short memory.[6N]
The town acts as our current hideout[,] away[N]
from the prying eyes of the imperial army.[AN]
The forests and mountains make for good[N]
cover against the wyverns of the empire[,][N]
and few maps have it etched.[AN]

[FFR]
Hey!![AN]

[MR][MoveRight]

[FFR][LoadGus][MoveFarRight]
Minister[,]Reverend[Beat] You've made it back[N]
in one piece![AN]

[L]
Gus[Beat] To think you would run to us in[N]
such a haste[Beat] Is something the matter?[AN]

[FR]
I bring ill tidings... There are... monsters![6N]
Monsters at Arma![AN]

[L]
That cannot be.[.6] Imperial soldiers have[N]
already found our hideout?[AN]

[FR]
No[,] Reverend[Beat] It's unexplainable.[.6][N]
Come with me![AN]

## Ch22Opening2

[FR]
I've located Captain Raya and the rest[N]
of the Resistance.[.6] Bad news is that[N]
they look like they're in a pinch.[AN]

[L]
We'll help them out.[.6] C'mon![.6] Let's go[,][N]
everybody come with me![AN]

[FL]
Quick to act[,] I see[Beat] Verna[,] do we know what[N]
we find ourselves facing against?[.6] Aside from[N]
the monsters[,] any Imperial troops?[AN]

[MR]
No soldiers.[.6] It's a horde of faceless[,] formless[N]
creatures who fade into ashes.[6N] I can't tell[N]
you any more than that.

[L]
Whatever it is, we can fend them off with steel[N]
and spells, yeah?[.6] Then let's get going.[AN]

[FL]
Do not cast judgment with rash decisions[,] Ser.[6N]
We have no knowledge of our enemies.[AN]

[L]
We have to act quickly before they overtake her.[.6][N]
Come on![AN]

Hah![.6] These things are getting kinda fun[N]
to crush![AN]

[FL]
Captain[Beat] The way it fades when the arrow exits[Beat][N]
It's disquieting.[AN]

[L]
Mind your step[,] Rina![AN]

[FR]
I'm fine![.6] Why do you spend so much time worrying?[AN]
[X]

## Ch22Opening4

[FL][LoadVerna][L][LoadChiffon][3L]
[L]
Those must be the ones we're looking for.[6N]
Alright[,] let's move in![AN]

[FL]
We have to get to them before the monsters do.[6N]
I'll follow you[,] Ser.[.6] I got your back.[AN]

[ML]
Sheeeeesh Ed[,] take a look at this.[.6][N]
We're finally entering the end of the[N]
world[,] eh?[AN][Clear]
Winter won't let up and neither will[N]
the horde![AN]

[MR]
Captain Solum[Beat] Watch your neck.[6N]
Look at how those creatures[Beat] squirm.[AN]

[ML]
You talking about the mercs or the revenants?[AN]

[MR]
Tsch[,] we don't have time for this.[6N]
If this is where the rebels are[,] then I[N]
say we just light up the damn place and scram.[AN]

[FFR]
Now what is this I hear about lighting up?[AN]

This is where the rebels were last sighted.[N]
But by the Serpent[Beat] It looks like I've[N]
found myself a few strays.[AN]

[FR]
Huh?![.6] M-Major Hayes?![AN]

[R]
Hayes[,] you scoundrel![.6] What the hell are you[N]
doing here?![AN]

[ML][MoveLeft]
Tell me:[.4] who let treacherous curs like you two[N]
lead the search for the rebels?[.6] Two idiots[N]
on such an important mission[Beat] Unthinkable![AN]

[R]
Uh[Beat] G-[.4]General Messel[Beat] told us to[N]
f-[.4]find them[,] no matter the cost![AN]

[FR]
You see[,] Major Hayes[Beat] Opal and Wellington[N]
are on a fortifying mission at the crown city.[6N]
We've been tasked to take care of the[AN]
rebels ourselves.[AN]

[L]
And your brilliant solution is to light a[N]
village ablaze?![.6] Nay, that is a crime[N]
upon this empire.[AN]
I cannot let you return to base in anything[N]
but chains.[AN]

[R]
Like you're one to talk[,] Major![.6] Justice at[N]
any cost is your strategy in motion![AN]

I'm getting out of here before this[N]
gets messy[Beat][AN][MoveFarFarRight]

## Ch22Opening8
[ML][LoadHaye][3L]
What a mess I've left behind[Beat][AN][C]
I suppose I must report back.[6N]
You rebels would be taken to the castle[N]
under less fortunate circumstances.[AN]
The next time our paths cross[,] my spear[N]
will find its target[,] and justice[N]
will be delivered.[AN]

[FR][LoadGraham]
Major General Haye of the imperial guard.[6N]
Ser, if I recall[,] you have prior history[N]
with him on the battlefield.[AN]

[R]
Yeah[,] I lost to him.[.6] He tried to push[N]
for my execution[,] but General Messel saw[N]
me spared.[AN]
Heh, I suppose I owe it to him that I'm[N]
still here.[AN]

[FR][LoadGraham]
What business could he possibly be here for?[N]
If he located the village[,] then we would[N]
best hurry.[AN]

[R]
Let's go.[.6] I'll find my chance to get even[N]
with Hayes later. Right now, we have to make sure[N]
the rest of the liberation army is okay.[AN]

How interesting.[AN][C]
In my pursuit of their whereabouts[,] I am led[N]
straight towards those I seek.[AN]

Remember me?[AN]

[ML]
Nay.[.6] Not at all.[AN]

[MR][LoadChiffonSickoMode]
How 'bout now?[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]Ah[,] the mercenary with strange powers.[6N]
For me to make so amateur a mistake.[6N]
And I thought I had you sent to Sele.[AN]

[MR]
Come at me[,] Hayes![.6] Let me leave a few[N]
scars on that scowl of yours.[AN]

[ML]
You are not my priority.[.6] Problems like you[N]
can be dealt with after.[AN]

So it's not just me. I wonder if they have souls to reap?
Whatever these things are, they're the enemy. Let's go!

[MR]
That became a bit of a mess in the end[,] huh?[6N]
Thanks, though. I can't say I'd know what[N]
would've become of us if y'all didn't show up.[AN]

[L]
Raya[,] is everyone unharmed?[.6] To think Imperial[N]
soldiers would join the fray[Beat][AN]

[MR]
That'd be nice[,] but we're not out unscathed.[6N]
But we can stand[,] and fight[,] if that[N]
matters to you.[AN]

[FL]
Captain Raya of the Resistance[,] it's a pleasure[N]
to meet you.[AN]

[MR]
Who's the lass with the golden eyes?[AN]

[FL]
Hi[,] I'm a mercenary recruited by the Order.[AN]

[MR]
You're a real shot with those crossbows[N]
of yours.[.6] I've never seen anybody fight[N]
quite like you.[AN]

[FL]
Uhm.[.6] Thanks[,] I guess.[AN]

Don't get too snug now[,] sister.[.6][N]
We'll need to depart soon for our first strike.[AN]

I must admit[Beat] I am weary as well.[AN]

[R]
The Order's leader[,] everyone.[.6] This is the last thing[N]
I would've expected to come from your[N]
mouth[,] Malcolm.[AN]

[L]
Wow[,] I'm really not used to the calm of[N]
this place.[.6] I think all this standing[N]
around might kill me.[AN]

[FL]
How does one have so much energy?[AN]

[L]
Chiffon[,] is it? You're fighting with us from now on.[6N]
It'd be good for you to meet your new allies.[AN]

[L]
Of course[,] Captain Raya.[.6] Pleasure working with you.[AN]

Drop the 'Captain'[,] little pup.[.6] You're not even[N]
part of my mercenaries.

Uh[,] got it[,] Raya.[AN]

[FR]
I second that notion.[.6] All of those who we[N]
rescued in the prison do not even know[N]

This is as excellent of an opportunity as any[N]
for you to bond with your rescuees.[AN]
