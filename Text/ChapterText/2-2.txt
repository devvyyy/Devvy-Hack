Graham
The outskirts of Arma. Ser, the town is our current hideout, away from the prying eyes of the imperial army. The forests and mountains make for good cover against the wyverns of the empire.

Generic Mage dude appears
Ngh... Minister... Reverend... You’ve made it back in one piece...

Yufka
Catch your breath. Is something the matter?

kid named Generic Mage dude
I bring naught but ill tidings... There are... monsters upon us!!

## 2-2Opening2

Verna appears from NOWHERE
Yup. Graham, I have good news and bad news. I located Captain Raya and the rest of the Resistance. Bad news is that they’re struggling to defend against the horde of... things.

Chiffon
We’ll help them out. C’mon! Let’s go!

Graham
Quick to act, I see... Verna, do we know what we find ourselves facing against? What kind of 'things’ are there, exactly?

Verna
It’s a horde of faceless, formless creatures... who fade into ashes. I can’t tell you more than that, man.

Chiffon
Whatever it is, we’ll be able to fend them off with steel and spells, yeah? Then let’s get going.

Graham
Do not cast judgment with rash decisions, leader. We have no knowledge of our enemies.

Chiffon
We have no choice. Do you want to abandon Captain Raya and leave her to the jaws of Imperial hounds?

Graham
Lead the way, then. You decide our next course of action. I look for options.

## 2-2Opening3

Raya
Hah! These things are getting kinda fun to crush!

Ilse
Captain... The way they fade when the arrow exits... It’s disquieting.

Pandoro
Mind your step, Rina! (sword slash sound into ding sound effect ?!)

Rina
I’m fine! Why do you spend so much time worrying? (cause this unit is ASS!!!1 bottom text)

## 2-2Opening4

Chiffon
Is this their whereabouts, Verna?

Verna
Yes, they’re all on the other side of the summit, Chiff.

Velius
[jumpup] Aiieeeeeeee! ...What in the world are those... abominations? They seem like magical beings... I can almost sense something familiar from them...

Yvonne
So it’s not just me. I wonder if they have souls to reap?

Verna
Whatever these things are, they’re the enemy. Let’s go.

## 2-2Opening5
Solum
Sheeeeesh, take a look at this. We’re finally entering the end of the world, eh? An endless storm... An eternal horde.

Edvin
Captain Solum... Watch your neck. Look at how those things... squirm.

Solum
You talking about the mercs or the revenants?

Edvin
Tsch, we don’t have time for this. If this is where the rebels are, then I say we just light up the whole damn place and scram.
[X]

## 2-2Opening6

Haye
This is where the rebels were last sighted, huh...? But by the Serpent...

Edvin
Huh?! Is that M-Major Haye?!

Solum
Haye, you snake! What the hell are you doing here?!

Haye
...
Tell me: who let treacherous curs like you two lead the search for the rebels?

Edvin
G-General Messel... Generals Opal and Wellington are on a fortifying mission at the crown city. We’ve been tasked to take care of the rebels ourselves.

Haye
And your solution is to light a village ablaze?! Nay, that is a crime upon this empire. I cannot let you return alone to base.

Edvin
I’m getting out of here before this gets messy... (he runs the fuck away lol)
[X]

## 2-2Opening7
Haye
Edvin, you... You coward! Solum, toss aside the torch. Lower your bow.

Edvin
H-Hell no! If I can get rid of you, then...

Haye
...(gba sword sheath sword effect) Stand down.
[X]

## 2-3InBattle1
Chiffon
That man right there... That’s the Viper...

Graham
Major General Haye of the imperial guard. Ser, if I recall... you had prior history with him on the battlefield?

Chiffon
That’s the man who overwhelmed me and a few others. He tried to push for my execution, but General Messel saw me spared. Heh, I suppose I owe it to him that I’m still here.

Graham
What business could he possibly be here for? I certainly hope he has not located our hideout.

Chiffon
It just means we need to hurry to the village. I’ll find my chance to get even with Haye later; right now, we have to make sure the rest of the liberation army is alright.
[X]

## SolumViperConvo

Solum
The Viper... You have no right to interfere!

Haye
An outlaw like you should never have been allowed in the imperial guard in the first place. You care naught for the holy empire, but you hunt only for riches!


Solum
The Trinity, the Duke, the Apostle—all will hear of this, whether in Wreyvine or Aeteria, Haye!

Haye
They will hear of this. I will make sure of it. And I will make sure my justice will be vindicated.

[X]

## MoveNearHaye
Haye
And in my pursuit of their whereabouts..... I am led straight to the Liberation army.

Chiffon
Hey... Remember me?

Haye
Nay. Not at all.

Chiffon
(overdrives) How 'bout now?

Haye
Ah, yes... The mercenary with strange powers. For me to make so amateur a mistake... Damn that Messel’s pardon! And I thought I sent you to the cells in Sele.

Chiffon
I’d leave a few scars on that scowl of yours, but then this wouldn’t be a fair fight, would it?

Haye
You are not my priority. Problems like you can be dealt with after.
[X]

## HayeLeaves
I would take you rebels with me to the castle, yet I know I cannot face all of you myself. The next time our paths cross, my spear will find its target. Justice will be delivered. You will all be arrested by the empire.
[X]

## 2-2Ending1
Raya
That was a bit of a mess in the end. Thanks, though. I can’t say I’d know what would’ve become of us if y'all didn’t show up.

Graham
Captain Raya, is everyone unharmed?

Raya
Tsch, that’d be nice, but we’re not out unscathed. But we can stand, and fight, if that matters to you.

Chiffon
Captain Raya of the Resistance. The village is nearby, yeah? Then—

Raya
Who’s the lass with the golden eyes?

Chiffon
Uhm. I’m a mercenary recruited by the Order.

Graham
This is Ser Chiffon. She is a formidable fighter. She has saved our forces time and time again. And...

Raya
And...?

Graham
Perish the thought.

Offscreen far right Villager guy
What is the ruckus out here? → move in
Ah, the liberators... Are you all okay?

Raya
Hey, Silas, what’s up?

Villager Guy
Captain Raya! You all look weary. Please return to the village at once. We’ll treat your injuries.

(village)
(Arma Village)

Graham
Phew... The cozy clutches of Arma, a brilliant sight for sore eyes. 

Chiffon
Is this the current base of operations?

Raya
For now, yes. Though, we’ll need to depart soon for our first strike. Chiffon, is it? If you’re fighting with us, go meet your new allies.

Chiffon
Of course, Captain Raya. Pleasure working with you.
