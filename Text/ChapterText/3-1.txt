C'mon![.6] You saw that[,] didn'tcha?[6N]
I was like[,] hiyah![.6] And that magic wraith[N]
thing split into ash![AN]

gonna come back to haunt us?[AN][CSS]

[MR][MoveRight][FR][Breve]
Tsch.[.6] You two are awfully calm for folks[N]

Hey![.6] I dodged like a CHAMP![.6][N]
Well[,] Stevia did.[.6] Was all grace and grit.[6N]

How about you focus on the [OpenQuote]skill" part?[AN]

Hah![.6] Breve's cranky again.[.6] Guess that[N]
means we're back to normal[,] eh?[AN]

[ML]
Hey[,] did you hear[,] Ansgar?[.6] About those[N]
wraiths.[.6] It's the Apostle's work[,] yeah[,][N]
but if she's gone missing[Beat][AN][C]
Then you think she's summoning these[N]
things of her own will?[AN]

[FR]
What kinda question is that?[6N]
Of course she is.[AN]

[ML]
Nobody knows where she is[,] not even[N]
the Imperial soldiers.[.6] I mean[,] are[N]
we sure it's even her work at this point?[AN]

[R]
Er[,] guess it could always be 'nother.[6N]
Like one of those nasty Consuls.[AN]

[ML]
No[,] no![.6] You're both missing the point.[6N]
I mean[,] the Apostle could be dead for[N]

this blasted war[,] and she hasn't been[N]
sighted ONCE.[AN]

You're losin' me[,] Hildr.[.6][N]

Think back to the palace siege.[6N]

Doesn't matter what shape they take.[6N]
We'll just need to continue cutting[N]
'em all down.[AN]

Focus[,] focus.[.6] You know what I think we[N]
need to do?[.6] Take down the Apostle.[AN]

You think that'll stop the hordes?[AN]

[ML]
I don't get this heebie-jeebie stuff[,] but[N]
if she's the source[,] then cutting down[N]
the source should stop 'em.[AN]

Makes sense t'me.[.6] Well done[,] Hildr![AN]

Are you stupid?[.6] I'm sure this conclusion's been[N]

I took Ulrich's name after he died[N]

You don't sound very surprised[,] General.[AN]

[MR]
Heh.[.6] The moment you didn't open with the[N]

up with you.[AN]

[ML]
Look[,] General[,] you deserve to know[N]
the truth--[AN]

[MR]
I knew you weren't him.[.6] I got over it.[6N]
When I told you about missing milestones[Beat][N]
Hell[,] I was just telling a stranger[,] huh?[AN][C]
Not like he ever knew about Oswald or[N]
what happened after the war.[AN]

[ML]
I'm sorry[,] General.[.6] I was a coward who took[N]
his face to survive.[AN]

[MR]
Don't be.[.6] I've fought beside both of you.[6N]
The real Ulrich and the one standing in[N]
front of me.[AN]
And I'd be damned if I said either of you[N]
weren't good people.[.6] We do what we[N]
can to survive[,] yeah?[AN]

[ML]
I suppose so.[.6] Then let me hold onto his[N]
name just a little longer.[.6] Just[N]
until this war's over or I fall.[AN]

After what I've seen today,[.4] that's[N]
the only conclusion I can come to.[AN]
This is too intricate to be a ruse.[AN][C]
I just don't know what their[N]
endgame is,[.4] and that bothers me.[AN]

[MR]
Are we seriously going to[N]
join forces with this same group[N]
who threw us into chains?[AN]

[ML]
I would prefer not to.[.6] But that[N]
will be up to Lord Gorlois to decide.[6N]
And knowing him[Beat][AN]

[MR]
He still mourns His Majesty's death.[6N]
I suspect he'd be just as wary of[N]
extending a hand to Imps as we are.[AN]

[ML]
We can only hope so.[AN]
