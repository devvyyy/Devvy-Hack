[ML][Hildr][MR][Ansgar]
[ML][MoveML]
C'mon![.6] You saw that[,] didn'tcha?[6N]
I was like[,] hiyah![.6] And that magic wraith[N]
thing split into ash![AN]

[MR]
I dunno[Beat] Ye think those thing's 're[N]
gonna come back to haunt us?[AN][CSS]

[MR][MoveRight][FR][Breve]
Tsch.[.6] You two are awfully calm for folks[N]
who barely made it back.[.6] Another swipe[N]
and Hildr would've been a smear.[AN]

[ML][MoveML]
Hey![.6] I dodged like a CHAMP![.6][N]
Well[,] Stevia did.[.6] Was all grace and grit.[6N]
I dominated with skill and stage presence.[AN]

[FR]
Hook at those hooves full of ash[,] huh?[6N]
How about you focus on the [OpenQuote]skill" part?[AN]

[R][MoveRight]
Hah![.6] Breve's cranky again.[.6] Guess that[N]
means we're back to normal[,] eh?[AN]

[ML]
Hey[,] did you hear[,] Ansgar?[.6] About those[N]
wraiths.[.6] It's the Apostle's work[,] yeah[,][N]
but if she's gone missing[Beat][AN][C]
Then you think she's summoning these[N]
things of her own will?[AN]

[FR]
What kinda question is that?[6N]
Of course she is.[AN]

[ML]
Nobody knows where she is[,] not even[N]
the Imperial soldiers.[.6] I mean[,] are[N]
we sure it's even her work at this point?[AN]

[R]
Er[,] guess it could always be 'nother.[6N]
Like one of those nasty Consuls.[AN]

[ML]
No[,] no![.6] You're both missing the point.[6N]
I mean[,] the Apostle could be dead for[N]
all we know.[AN]
It's been 7 months since the start of[N]
this blasted war[,] and she hasn't been[N]
sighted ONCE.[AN]

[R]
You're losin' me[,] Hildr.[.6][N]
Come on[,] hammer it in![AN]

[ML]
Think back to the palace siege.[6N]
Even if she wasn't at the final battle[,][N]
her soldiers were.[AN]
I'm betting that she's losing control[N]
of these wraiths.[.6] Think about it:[4N]
they're so[Beat] savage now.[AN]

[FR]
Doesn't matter what shape they take.[6N]
We'll just need to continue cutting[N]
'em all down.[AN]

[R]
Heh[,] spoken like a man married to[N]
the battlefield.[AN]

[ML]
Focus[,] focus.[.6] You know what I think we[N]
need to do?[.6] Take down the Apostle.[AN]

[FR]
You think that'll stop the hordes?[AN]

[ML]
I don't get this heebie-jeebie stuff[,] but[N]
if she's the source[,] then cutting down[N]
the source should stop 'em.[AN]

[R]
Makes sense t'me.[.6] Well done[,] Hildr![AN]

[FR]
Are you stupid?[.6] I'm sure this conclusion's been[N]
brought up dozens of times before.[.6][N]
We don't know where the Apostle is.[AN]

[ML]
Oh[,] right![.6] Blast it all![.6][N]
Alright[,] I got another idea[Beat][AN]

[ML][Ulrich]
Urgh[Beat] The wind's different today.[6N]
[Pause]Twenty-four years.[.6] One war[,] and[N]
another storm continues to hit us[Beat][AN]
What sort of future would we leave behind?[6N]
What would he even want?[.6] Even my steps[N]
on the snow have already faded.[AN]
Seven months since the fall of the king[Beat][N]
How many more days must pass before[N]
history forgets us all?[AN]

[FFR][Wegman]
Talking to the northern winds again[,] Ulrich?[AN][CSS]

[MoveMidRight]
[MR]
I thought I'd find you over here.[6N]
You always liked your quiet spots.[AN]

[ML]
Eh[,] it's a recent thing.[.6] And plus[,][N]
you're up early too[,] General.[.6] What[,][N]
sleep eluded you as well?[AN]

[MR]
How did the saying go?[.6] First tracks[N]
claim the hunt?[.6] First to stoke the[N]
fire warms the longest?[AN][C]
I always check the perimeter before sun-up.[6N]
Old habits die hard[,] right?[AN]

[ML]
Mm[,] some habits keep you alive.[AN]

[MR]
Nobody else is around[,] friend.[.6] You're really[N]
good at picking spots that nobody wants[N]
to wander to.[AN]

[ML]
We've been relocating from hideout to hideout[N]
to evade Imperial fliers.[.6] Our time in[N]
this fort is running out.[AN]

[MR]
You remember what this place is[,] Ulrich?[6N]
Fort Arkstad[,] built as a hidden shelter[N]
during the most frigid months.[AN]
First battle we fought here together[,][N]
you fell off your horse.[.6] And you[N]
know what you told me?[AN]

[ML]
[Beat]Care to remind me?[.6] My memory's not quite[N]
what it used to be.[AN]

[MR]
[OpenQuote]Welp[,] that's it for Ol' Rick's equestrianism.[6N]
Hey[,] Elias[Beat] can you fetch a friar?[6N]
I think I'm better off on foot."[AN]

[ML]
[Beat]I see.[AN]

[.4]
[MR]
Lieutenant[Beat] You're not really Ulrich[,][N]
are you?[AN][Event]

[ML]
[Mouth]........[Mouth][AN]

[MR]
He had a booming voice.[.6] Laughed like a[N]
drunk fox[,] too.[.6] I thought it was age[N]
that mellowed you out[,] but[Beat][AN]

[ML]
[Pause]General.[AN]

[MR]
You don't drink like him and you don't[N]
really fight like him.[.6] And he'd never[N]
walk around calling me [OpenQuote]General".[AN]

[ML]
[Mouth]............[Mouth][AN]

[MR]
So[Beat] Who the hell are you really?[6N]
Who was the scowling man I met at the[N]
palace[,] seven months ago?[AN]

[ML]
Sigh[Beat] A deserter.[.6] From the empire.[6N]
I took Ulrich's name after he died[N]
beside me.[AN]

[MR]
So it seems.[AN]

[ML]
You don't sound very surprised[,] General.[AN]

[MR]
Heh.[.6] The moment you didn't open with the[N]
handshake[,] I knew there was something[N]
up with you.[AN]

[ML]
Look[,] General[,] you deserve to know[N]
the truth--[AN]

[MR]
I knew you weren't him.[.6] I got over it.[6N]
When I told you about missing milestones[Beat][N]
Hell[,] I was just telling a stranger[,] huh?[AN][C]
Not like he ever knew about Oswald or[N]
what happened after the war.[AN]

[ML]
I'm sorry[,] General.[.6] I was a coward who took[N]
his face to survive.[AN]

[MR]
Don't be.[.6] I've fought beside both of you.[6N]
The real Ulrich and the one standing in[N]
front of me.[AN]
And I'd be damned if I said either of you[N]
weren't good people.[.6] We do what we[N]
can to survive[,] yeah?[AN]

[ML]
I suppose so.[.6] Then let me hold onto his[N]
name just a little longer.[.6] Just[N]
until this war's over or I fall.[AN]

[MR]
[Smile]
I'll be hoping it's the former[,] Lieutenant.[6N]
Don't die before I can call you something[N]
other than [OpenQuote]Ulrich".[AN][Smile][CSS]

[FFR][Soldier]
General Wegman![.6] Lieutenant Ulrich![AN][CSS]

[MR][CF]

[ML][MoveFL]
[L][Wegman]

[FFR][MoveFarRight]
[FR]
What a strange place to elope to[Beat][AN]

[L]
Is something amiss[,] my good sir?[AN]

[FR]
Yes.[.6] The scouts have returned:[.4][N]
there are more of those wraiths![6N]
We must secure the area at once.[AN]

[FL]
Is that all that was spotted?[AN]

[FR]
Yes[,] sir.[.6] No Imperial troops in sight.[6N]
Follow me![.6] The others are preparing for[N]
the battle as we speak.[AN]

[FL][Wegman][R][Klavdia][FR][Gerolf]
[FFL][Ulrich][MoveLeft]

[R]
Look what the wyvern's dragged in.[6N]
[Pause]Habitual lateness.[AN]

[FL][MoveFL]
Ooh[,] you wound me[,] my friend.[.6] Deeply.[AN]

[R]
You'll survive[,] General.[.6] I believe in you.[AN]

[L]
Will we be forced to relocate again?[6N]
I hope this wasn't a sign of the[N]
Emperor discerning our location.[AN]

[FR]
I don't think so.[.6] These wraiths feel[N]
wild and free[Beat] Almost like puppets[N]
without their strings.[AN]

[R]
Waxing poetic again with gut instinct[N]
deciding the fate of our lives?[.6][N]
I've seen worse odds.[AN]
The border fortress was attacked last night.[6N]
We've no identity of the assailants.[6N]
Could be raiders.[AN]

[FL]
That's where our captains were taken.[6N]
The army has secured the New Province border[N]
fortress.[.6] We're only two days away.[AN]

[FR]
[OpenQuote]New Province"![.6] Bah![AN]

[L]
[Pause]You think they're still alive?[6N]
No[,] now isn't the time to think[N]
about this.[AN][C]
We'll take them back after this[N]
battle's over.[AN]

[R]
They circle our outer walls[,] but they've[N]
yet to strike.[.6] Let's take this chance[N]
to remove them all swiftly.[AN]

Agreed.[.6] Charge[,] everyone![.6][N]
Let's come play![AN]

[ML][Ulrich]

[ML][MoveMidLeft]
Hey[,] is everyone alright?[6N]
Was chaotic out here.[AN]
[CSS]

[FFR][Wegman][MoveMidRight]
I'm here[,] Lieutenant.[.6] I did another round[N]
of the border walls.[.6] Initial reading says[N]
no movement[,] no trails but the animals.[AN]

[CSS]
[MR][MoveFarRight]

[R][Klavdia]
Didn't know you were a scout now[,] General.[6N]
Patrolling clad in full armor as well.[.6][N]
Your stamina's impressive.[AN]

[FR]
I'll take that as a genuine one from you[,][N]
Klavdia.[.6] What can I say?[.6] Exercise[N]
keeps you marching on.[AN]

[ML]
So they came out of nowhere[,] and vanished[N]
the same way.[.6] We have to get to[N]
the bottom of this.[AN]

[FFL][Gorlois]
Didn't you hear your men earlier[,] Ulrich?[6N]
The Apostle must be slain.[AN][CSS][Event]

[ML][CF][R][CF][FR][CF][.4]

[MR][Ulrich]

[FFL][MoveMidLeft]

[MR]
Lord Gorlois[Beat] Any results?[AN]

[ML]
The flock has been searching.[.6] They've[N]
flown high over the Imperial heartland[,][N]
the ruined border keeps[,] through mountains.[AN]

[MR]
And yet we still have no trace of where[N]
the Apostle resides?[AN]

[ML]
Something clouds her presence.[.6] It's[N]
as if she were hidden by a blizzard.[6N]
I sensed two of these shrouded targets.[AN]

[MR]
We fled the wolves only to find the bear[,][N]
it seems.[.6] Could the other be Selwyn?[6N]
Is there any hope for us to win this war?[AN]

[ML]
Your fear is unfounded[,] Lieutenant.[6N]
This battle is won.[.6] Why[,] many in the[N]
reserves didn't even know of the threat.[AN]

[MR]
Fair enough.[.6] What else have your[N]
crows been seeing?[AN]

[ML]
There is another army.[.6] They've just crossed[N]
the bridge between our nations with[N]
weapons drawn.[AN]

[MR]
Hostiles[,] then.[AN]

[ML]
I am not quite sure[,] myself.[.6] They bear[N]
no particular flag.[.6] An assortment of[N]
Aeterians[,] I say.[AN]
There was a rebellion to the east.[6N]
The image lines up:[.4] they could prove[N]
to be valuable allies.[AN]
But do try to proceed with due diligence[,][N]
yes?[.6] We tread on the blade's edge[N]
with each passing day.[AN]

[MR]
You don't presume the sudden appearance of[N]
those things means the Emperor knows[N]
where we are[,] right?[AN]

[ML]
There's a small town two days west of here--[.4][N]
Halds.[.6] It's abandoned[,] but the defensive[N]
points are fully in-tact for now.[AN]
It'll serve as our next position.[6N]
I'll send a messenger when the time comes[,][N]
but be prepared to ride at dawn.[AN][C]
Keep your blades sharpened and your[N]
back to eachother.[AN]

[MR]
We'll be careful[,] then.[.6] I wish you a[N]
safe journey back[,] Lord Gorlois.[AN]
