[ToggleMouthMove](Why is that face so familiar...?)[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Sir.[.6] Is the enemy leader one who's[N]
renowned in Aeteria?[AN] 

[OpenMidRight]
It's been many years since Sir Alicot last[N]
showed his face in Wreyvine[,] I'd say.[6N]
What makes you ask of an Aeterian knight?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove](That doesn't explain why I recognise him.)[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I'm trying to keep myself informed with[N]
Wreyvine and Aeteria's commanders.[AN]
It'll be important for me to keep track of[N]
which ones are particularly noteworthy[N]
or renowned on the front.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Then say[Beat] Have you met many of Wreyvine's[N]
captains and generals[,] Affogato?[.6] Take[N]
Captain Stroganoff for example.[AN]
If we fail our mission here[,] it'd be quite[N]
a big hit for Wreyvine.[.6] I don't like the[N]
guy[,] but he's pretty important.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
A few in name[,] never in nature.[AN]
I know what that Captain is like.[.6] With that[N]
in mind[,] I'm fine with never crossing paths.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
He's a bit of a[Beat] a lot of things[,][N]
actually[Beat] but we still must do[N]
our duty.[AN][Clear]
Remind me;[.4] how long have you been part[N]
of Wreyvine's forces?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Months.[.6] I never bothered speaking to[N]
them personally.[.6] Most of the time[,][N]
scouting is solitary work.[AN][Clear]
Scouting puts you in a vulnerable position.[.6][N]
You're less so when you're detached from[N]
what's unrelated to the mission.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I wish I had your stoic stance on work[N]
back when I was a squire[,] Affogato.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Is that so?[an]

[OpenMidRight]
I imagine it certainly would've made many[N]
