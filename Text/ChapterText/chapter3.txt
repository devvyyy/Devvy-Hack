## Ch3Opening1
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadDoppio][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Captain![.6] Captain![.6] Aeterian soldiers are[N]
surrounding the city![AN]
Their leader seems to have taken[N]
control of the inn.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadEis][OpenLeft][LoadStroganoff]
[OpenFarLeft][Pause][CloseEyes]Did you say Aeterians?[.6] [OpenEyes]I really[N]
don't get paid enough for this.[AN]
[OpenLeft]The inn?[.6] Man has his[N]
priorities straight,[.4] huh?[AN]
Do we know the identity behind[N]
such a[Beat] refined leader?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
It looks to be General Alicot of Aeteria;[.4][N]
he comes from Omios,[.4] Aeteria's crown city.[AN]
[OpenLeft]
Oh,[.4] bloody hell.[.6] [CloseEyes]Of course[N]
it is[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]
One day you have a drinking buddy and the[N]
next,[.4] they invade your city's inn![AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
How many Aeterian forces did you spot[N]
outside,[.4] Doppio?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
There's too many for me[N]
to count,[.4] Espresso[Beat][AN]
And I know more knights are[N]
on the way.[AN]

[OpenLeft][MoveLeft]
No need to panic.[.6] Just stay behind my[N]
shield-[.4] I'm sure aid is coming.[AN]
Come on![.6] Bring it on,[.4] we[N]
live for battle![AN]
Got it?[.6] Defend the[N]
city at all costs![A][X]

## Ch3Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich][OpenFarFarRight][LoadAffogato][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidRight]
I've scouted ahead.[.6] So,[.4] this is[N]
the capital city of Northelm, huh?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
The outer city, yes. It was built ages[N]
ago after a long battle,[AN]
and so borders abandoned fortresses.[N]
Too bad for the city guard.[AN]
The entirety of the capital city is[N]
centered on the fountain.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
More importantly,[.4] there seems to be[N]
a skirmish in the city square.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.4][MoveRight]

[OpenFarRight][LoadHildr]
The Northelm city guard looks to[N]
be up ahead![AN]
They seem to be in huge trouble,[.4][N]
being surrounded like that![AN]
I'm not sure the lot can last[N]
much longer[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidRight]You weren't kidding about Aeterians[N]
being everywhere,[.4] Affogato.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]I don't remember the Aeterian army[N]
being this grand before[Beat][AN]

[OpenRight]Mm,[.4] unfortunately.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][Pause][OpenEyes]Fine,[.4] we[N]
go[.4] now![A][X]

## Ch3OpeningAlt2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich][OpenMidRight][LoadAffogato]
[OpenMidRight]I've scouted ahead,[.4] sir.[.6][N]
There seems to be a skirmish.[AN]
Forces of Wreyvine's capital city guard seem[N]
to be encircled by Aeterian soldiers.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Mm, you were right about Aeterians[N]
being everywhere,[.4] Affogato.[AN]
I don't remember the Aeterian army[N]
being this grand before[Beat][AN]
[OpenRight]Mm,[.4] unfortunately.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][Pause][OpenEyes]Fine,[.4] we[N]
go[.4] now![A][X]

## Ch3Ending1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadAffo][OpenFarRight][LoadAlicot]
[OpenFarLeft]Look,[.4] you have to tell[N]
me why.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][Pause]Huh?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Tell me.[.6] You're a general[N]
of Aeteria.[.6] Why the invasion?[AN]

[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][Pause][ToggleSmile]Heh[Beat][ToggleSmile] Wouldn't you[Beat] like[N]
to know?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]I know you want to sound[N]
remarkable and all,[AN]
but I'd really appreciate if we[N]
just got this over with.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
[Pause]The Queen and Aeteria's Trinity spoke[N]
of the prophecy[Beat][AN]
That you Wreyvians were going to[N]
cast us back into the shadows.[AN]
That Wreyvine will eclipse Aeteria[N]
once and for all[Beat][AN]
[MoveMidRight]
We will take the Eye[Beat] No matter[N]
the cost[Beat][AN][CloseEyes][ClearFace][0x80][0x2D][0x86][0x8D][0x80][0x80]

[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][ToggleMouthMove]
(So it's true,[.4] then.[.6] The Aeterians[N]
from the ship weren't lying.)[AN][CloseEyes]
(This war started[Beat] because pretentious old[N]
generals can't let go of old legends?)[AN]
(All of this bloodshed over an inability[N]
to change[Beat]?)[AN][X]

## Ch3Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStroganoff][OpenRight][LoadAffogato][OpenFarRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidLeft]You blokes really saved[N]
our hides back there.[AN]
Northelm is secure,[.4] and the Aeterians[N]
have been driven back.[AN]
[OpenRight]The general mentioned a[N]
prophecy.[AN]
One where Wreyvine will[Beat][N]
eclipse Aeteria.[AN]
Do you know what he means[N]
by that?[AN]

[Event]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ah,[.4] you're talkin' 'bout[N]
the 'Eternal Winter'.[AN]

[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]
(Oh no,[.4] what did I get[N]
myself into?)[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
The Eternal Winter,[.4] huh?[.6] [Pause]Mm,[.4][N]
sounds like a bunch of nonsense.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Legends say that when a monarch of Ideon[N]
grasps both heirlooms in their hands,[AN]
they can choose Ideon's final reality,[.4][N]
eclipsing the other kingdom in its wake.[AN]
The fallen kingdom gets blighted with[N]
the One's snow or the Rider's ashes,[AN]
just as legend tells with the Hallowed One[N]
and the Ashen Rider eons ago.[AN]
[MoveMidLeft]
[Pause]But nobody in Wreyvine really believes in[N]
such lore or legends anymore,[.4] [CloseEyes][MoveMidLeft]bahahahaha![AN][OpenEyes]

[OpenRight]
Yet the people of Aeteria believe[N]
in such a legend,[.4] right?[AN]
I wonder why the Aeterians are believin'[N]
in the legend again?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
You not from Wreyvine or[N]
something?[AN]
We've always been less devout than[N]
the ones across the bridge.[AN]
I mean,[.4] we do have blokes like[N]
Gorlois here in Wreyvine[Beat][AN]
Mutters to his bloody crow[N]
all day.[AN]
Bettin' ya he believes in[N]
the legend as well.[AN]

[OpenRight]
These two kingdoms aren't too[N]
different,[.4] I suppose.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
I mean,[.4] all that separates us is[N]
the great bridge in the center.[AN]

[OpenFarFarLeft]Hey,[.4] Captain![AN][X]

## Ch3EndingAlt2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffogato][OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidRight]So,[.4] What did we learn?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't[Beat] rush into[N]
danger head on?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We couldn't win without[N]
any losses.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What will we do now?[.6] Wreyvine[N]
is down a captain.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We'll just have to move[N]
on without the ones we lost.[AN]
It's not ideal,[.4] but we[N]
don't have a choice[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The general mentioned a[N]
prophecy.[AN]
One where Wreyvine will[Beat][N]
eclipse Aeteria.[AN]
Do you know what he means[N]
by that?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][Pause]No,[.4] unfortunately not.[.6][N]
Though I reckon-[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]Hey![A][X]

## Ch3Ending3
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadAtheya][OpenRight][LoadStroganoff][OpenFarRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenRight]Look who the wyvern dragged in.[.6][N]
G'day,[.4] Captain Brudet.[AN]
You're a bit late to the[N]
party,[.4] ya know.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Aeterians are approaching[N]
the city border.[AN]
This is dire,[.4] Strogy.[.6][N]
We need reinforcements.[AN]
I would lend my strength,[.4] but[N]
I have other matters to attend to.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]The border?[.6] Like[Beat] the[N]
southern border outpost?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]Correct,[.4] Cap'n.[.6] They breached the[N]
outpost,[.4] and are[AN]
now using it as a sort[N]
of hideout.[AN]

[OpenRight]Well,[.4] what're we[N]
waiting for?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]There's no time to waste.[.6][N]
Let's go,[.4] everyone.[A][X]

## Ch3EndingAlt3
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadAtheya][OpenRight][LoadAffo][OpenFarRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenFarRight]Ah,[.4] Captain Brudet.[.6][N]
Is everything alright?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Where is Stroganoff?[AN]
[OpenRight]The Captain didn't make[N]
it,[.4] but[Beat][N]
[OpenMidLeft]He[.4] what?![.6] Damn it[Beat][N]
[CloseEyes]If only if I was here sooner[Beat][AN]
[OpenFarRight]We have to continue,[.4][N]
no matter the cost.[AN]
What brought you here,[.4][N]
Captain Brudet?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It feels like one disaster[N]
after another[Beat][AN]
Aeterians are invading through[N]
the city borders.[AN]
We can't hold them back-[.4] we[N]
need reinforcements.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]The city borders[Beat] Did they take[N]
hold of the outpost?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Correct.[.6] They breached the[N]
outpost,[.4] and are[AN]
now using it as a[N]
hideout.[AN]
I would lend my strength,[.4] but[N]
I have other matters to attend to.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Well,[.4] what're we[N]
waiting for?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We must prevent anything like[N]
this from happening again.[AN]
Follow me,[.4] the outpost isn't[N]
too far from here.[A][X]

## Ch3BridgeWarning
[OpenLeft][LoadAffogato]If we can't reach[N]
the ledge,[AN]
perhaps one of us can[N]
[ToggleRed]create a bridge[ToggleRed]?[A][X]

## Ch3ReinWarning
[OpenLeft][LoadAlicot]Pitiful knights.[.6] They're[N]
too late.[AN]
We're already in control of[N]
the capital of Northelm.[AN]
Let's move,[.4] surround the Wreyvians[N]
with a storm of riders![A][X]

It's been a beacon of hope[N]

I joined the knights.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]These reinforcements seem[N]
endless[Beat][AN]

I'm betting if we take out[N]
their leader,[AN]
they have no choice but to[N]
stop the reinforcements.[AN]
There'd be no one to[N]

[OpenMidLeft]Yeah,[.4] that makes[N]
