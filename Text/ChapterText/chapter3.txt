Captain![.6] Captain![.6] Aeterian soldiers are[N]
surrounding the city![AN]
Their leader seems to have taken[N]
control of the inn.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadEis][OpenLeft][LoadStroganoff]
[OpenFarLeft][Pause][CloseEyes]Did you say Aeterians?[.6] [OpenEyes]I really[N]
don't get paid enough for this.[AN]
[OpenLeft]The inn?[.6] Man has his[N]
priorities straight.[AN]
Anyhow,[.4] was nice knowing[N]
you blokes.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][MidBlink]Captain Stroganoff[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]

jests.[.6] I get it.[AN]

aid is coming.[AN]
Got it?[.6] Defend the[N]
city at all costs![A][X]

There seems to be a skirmish.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveRight]
[OpenFarRight][LoadHildr]
The city guard looks to be[N]
up ahead![AN]
I'm not sure the lot can last[N]
much longer[Beat][AN]

[OpenFarLeft]Look,[.4] you have to tell[N]
me why.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][Pause]Huh?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Tell me.[.6] Why did Aeteria[N]
invade Wreyvine?[AN]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][Pause][ToggleSmile]Heh[Beat][ToggleSmile] Wouldn't you[Beat] like[N]
to know?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]I know you want to sound[N]
remarkable and all,[AN]
but I'd really appreciate if we[N]

[OpenMidRight]You Wreyvians were going to[N]
cast us back into the shadows[Beat][AN]
We will take the Eye[Beat] No matter[N]
the cost[Beat][AN][CloseEyes][X]

## Ch3Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStroganoff][OpenRight][LoadAffogato][OpenFarRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidLeft]You blokes really saved[N]
our hides back there.[AN]
Northelm is secure,[.4] and the Aeterians[N]
have been driven back.[AN]
[OpenRight]That's it,[.4] then?[.6] Their leader said they were[N]
going to take the "Eye".[AN]
I,[.4] uh,[.4] have no idea[N]
what that means.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Ya not from Wreyvine[N]
or something?[AN]
[OpenRight][Beat][AN]
[OpenMidLeft]They want Wreyvine's great heirloom.[.6] We[N]
can't let 'em have it.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Anyways,[.4] this can't be the only[N]
place they attacked,[.4] correct?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Not a chance.[.6] Look around[N]
and-[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]Hey![A][X]

## Ch3EndingAlt2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffogato][OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidRight]So,[.4] What did we learn?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't[Beat] rush into[N]
danger head on?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We couldn't win without[N]
any losses.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What will we do now?[.6] Wreyvine[N]
is down a captain.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We'll just have to move[N]
on without the ones we lost.[AN]
It's not ideal,[.4] but we[N]
don't have a choice.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Their leader said they were[N]
going to take the "Eye".[AN]
I,[.4] uh,[.4] have no idea[N]
what that means.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Wreyvine's great heirloom?[.6][N]
The Aeterians want it?[AN]
Seems like it would be in our best[N]
interest to not let them have it.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Sounds simple enough.[.6][N]
Why would they want it,[.4][N]
though[Beat]?[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]Hey![A][X]

G'day,[.4] Captain Brudet.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Aeterians are approaching[N]
the city border.[AN]
This is dire,[.4] Captain.[.6][N]
We need reinforcements.[AN]
I would lend my strength,[.4] but[N]
I have other matters to attend to.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]The border?[.6] Like[Beat] the[N]
southern border outpost?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]Correct.[.6] They breached the[N]
outpost,[.4] and are[AN]
now using it as a[N]

[OpenFarRight]Ah,[.4] Captain Brudet.[.6][N]
Is everything alright?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Where is Stroganoff?[AN]
[OpenRight]The Captain didn't make[N]
it,[.4] but[Beat][N]
[OpenMidLeft]He[.4] what?![.6] Damn it[Beat][N]
[CloseEyes]If only if I was here sooner[Beat][AN]
[OpenFarRight]We have to continue,[.4][N]
no matter the cost.[AN]
What brought you here,[.4][N]
Captain Brudet?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It feels like one disaster[N]
after another[Beat][AN]
Aeterians are invading through[N]
the city borders.[AN]
We can't hold them back-[.4] we[N]
need reinforcements.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]The city borders[Beat] Did they take[N]
hold of the outpost?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Correct.[.6] They breached the[N]
outpost,[.4] and are[AN]
now using it as a[N]
hideout.[AN]
I would lend my strength,[.4] but[N]
I have other matters to attend to.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Well,[.4] what're we[N]
waiting for?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We must prevent anything like[N]
this from happening again.[AN]
Follow me,[.4] the outpost isn't[N]
too far from here.[A][X]
