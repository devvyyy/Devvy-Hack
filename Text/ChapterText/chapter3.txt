[OpenMidRight]I've scouted ahead,[.4] sir.[.6][N]
There seems to be a skirmish.[AN][MoveRight]
[OpenFarRight][LoadHildr]
Captain Stroganoff and his men[N]
are up ahead![AN]
I'm not sure they can last[N]
much longer[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That doesn't sound good.[.6] Any[N]
information on the enemy?[AN]
[OpenRight]Looks to be mostly pirates[N]
and raiders,[.4] sir.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][Pause][OpenEyes]Fine,[.4] we[N]

## Ch3Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStroganoff][OpenRight][LoadAffogato][OpenFarRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidLeft]Sir Ulrich,[.4][ToggleSmile] you really saved[N]
our hides back there.[AN]
Athium is secure,[.4] and the shamans[N]
have been driven back.[AN]
[OpenRight]I'm still not convinced.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hrm?[AN]
[OpenRight]There are too many unanswered[N]
questions[Beat][AN]
[OpenFarRight]We still don't know the[N]
source of such a threat.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Aye,[.4] but-[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]Captain Stroganoff![A][X]

## Ch3EndingAlt2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffogato][OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidLeft]Athium is saved[Beat] but[N]
[CloseEyes]it didn't feel like a victory[Beat]
[OpenMidRight]We couldn't do it without[N]
casualties.[AN]
That's expected,[.4] but this[N]
is the loss of a captain.[AN]
I'm not sure how quickly Athium[N]
can appoint a new captain,[.4] either.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]And we still don't know the[N]
source of the threat.[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]Captain Stroganoff![A][X]

[OpenRight]Captain Atheya?[.6] What could[N]
possibly bring you here?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]At the kingdom's edge,[.4] forces[N]
approach.[AN]
I'm not sure the guards can keep[N]
up-[.4] we need reinforcements.[AN]
[OpenRight]They're awfully relentless,[.4] eh?[.6][N]
If it's as dire as you say,[AN]
then it'd be wise for us to[N]
move at once.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Indeed.[.4] Let's move,[.4][N]
everyone.[A][X]

## Ch3EndingAlt3
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadAtheya][OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]Where is the captain?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]He didn't make it,[.4] but[Beat][N]
[OpenMidLeft]He what?![.6] Damn it[Beat][N]
[CloseEyes]If only if I was here sooner[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidRight]We're down a captain,[.4] but[N]
Athium will not break.[AN]
What brought you here,[.4][N]
Captain?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It feels like one disaster[N]
after another.[AN]
At the kingdom's edge,[.4] forces[N]
approach.[AN]
I'm not sure the guards can keep[N]
up-[.4] we need reinforcements.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Let's move out at[N]
once,[.4] then.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Indeed.[.6] We must prevent anything[N]
like this from happening again.[A][X]

## Ch3ReinWarning
[OpenLeft][LoadAlicot]We're in control of[N]
Athium.[AN]
