[OpenMidRight]I've scouted ahead,[.4] sir.[.6][N]
There seems to be a skirmish.[AN][MoveRight]
[OpenFarRight][LoadHildr]
Captain Stroganoff and his men[N]

I'm not sure they can last[N]

[OpenFarLeft]Tell me.[.6] Why did Aeteria[N]
invade Wreyvine?[AN]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][Pause][ToggleSmile]Heh[Beat][ToggleSmile] Wouldn't you[Beat] like[N]
to know?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]I know you want to sound[N]

## Ch3Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadStroganoff][OpenRight][LoadAffogato][OpenFarRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidLeft]You blokes really saved[N]
our hides back there.[AN]
Athium is secure,[.4] and the shamans[N]
have been driven back.[AN]
[OpenRight]I'm still not convinced.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hrm?[AN]
[OpenRight]There are too many unanswered[N]
questions[Beat][AN]
[OpenFarRight]We still don't know the[N]
source of such a threat.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Aye,[.4] but-[AN]

## Ch3EndingAlt2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffogato][OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidLeft]Athium is saved[Beat] but[N]
[CloseEyes]it didn't feel like a victory[Beat]
[OpenMidRight]We couldn't do it without[N]
casualties.[AN]
That's expected,[.4] but this[N]
is the loss of a captain.[AN]
I'm not sure how quickly Athium[N]
can appoint a new captain,[.4] either.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]And we still don't know the[N]
source of the threat.[AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft]Captain Stroganoff![A][X]

[OpenRight]Captain Brudet?[.6] What could[N]
possibly bring you here?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]At the kingdom's edge,[.4] shamans[N]
are approaching.[AN]
I'm not sure the guards can keep[N]
up-[.4] we need reinforcements.[AN]
The Keepers-[.4] the cultists cannot[N]
be allowed to push forward.[AN]
[OpenRight]The[Beat] Keepers?[.6] [MoveRight]The hell[N]
type of moniker is that?![AN]
[OpenFarRight]My squadron has seen a fair[N]
share of these 'Keepers',[.4] too.[AN]
[OpenRight]They're awfully relentless,[.4] eh?[.6][N]
If it's as dire as you say,[AN]
then it'd be wise for us to[N]
move at once.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Indeed.[.4] Let's move,[.4][N]
everyone.[A][X]

## Ch3EndingAlt3

[OpenMidRight]He didn't make it,[.4] but[Beat][N]
[OpenMidLeft]He[.4] what?![.6] Damn it[Beat][N]
[CloseEyes]If only if I was here sooner[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidRight]We're down a captain,[.4] but[N]
Athium will not break.[AN]
What brought you here,[.4][N]
Captain?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]It feels like one disaster[N]
after another.[AN]
At the kingdom's edge,[.4] shamans[N]
are approaching.[AN]
I'm not sure the guards can keep[N]
up-[.4] we need reinforcements.[AN]
The Keepers cannot be allowed[N]
to push forward.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The[Beat] Keepers?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]His Majesty has given[N]
the cultists that name.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Hm.[.6] Let's move out[N]
at once.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Indeed.[.6] We must prevent anything[N]
