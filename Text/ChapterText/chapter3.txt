[MR]
Hmm[Beat] Sir Alicoth of the Imperial guard.[6n]
It's been a while since he's last[N]
shown his sorry face in Wreyvine.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Sir.[.6] Is the enemy leader particularly[Beat][N]
renowned in the Empire?[AN] 

[OpenMidRight]
He was a representative for Aeteria in[N]
times of diplomacy and courthood.[6N]
What makes you ask of an Aeterian knight?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
You brought him up[,] and I think that[N]
keeping myself informed with the lands'[N]
commanders will aid the mission.[AN]
It'll be important for me to keep track of[N]
which ones are particularly noteworthy[N]
or renowned on the front.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Then say[Beat] Have you met many of Wreyvine's[N]
captains and generals[,] Affogato?[.6] Take[N]
Captain Stroganoff for example.[AN]
If we fail our mission here[,] it'd be quite[N]
a big hit for Wreyvine.[.6] I don't like the[N]
guy[,] but he's pretty important.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
A few in name[,] never in nature.[AN]
I know what that Captain is like.[.6] With that[N]
in mind[,] I'm fine with never crossing paths.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
He's a bit of a[Beat] a lot of things[,][N]
actually[Beat] but we still must do[N]
our duty.[AN][Clear]
Remind me;[.4] how long have you been part[N]
of Wreyvine's forces?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Months.[.6] I never bothered speaking to[N]
them personally.[.6] Most of the time[,][N]
scouting is solitary work.[AN][Clear]
Scouting puts you in a vulnerable position.[.6][N]
You're less so when you're detached from[N]
what's unrelated to the mission.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I wish I had your stoic stance on work[N]
back when I was a squire[,] Affogato.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Is that so?[an]

[OpenMidRight]
I imagine it certainly would've made many[N]
lives a lot easier[Beat][AN]

Hey Eisner[,] how'd you manage to ride a[N]
beast as ferocious as a mighty griffon?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Flanagan is a calm griffon[,] but he wasn't[N]
always like that.[.6] He gave me one hell[N]
of a nasty scar.[AN]
Was totally my fault[,] though.[.6] I didn't[N]
respect his boundaries when trying to tame[N]
this fellow.[AN]

[MidRight]
You tamed him?[.6] By yourself?![.6] If you're[N]
such a wonder with animals[,] then how'd[N]
you end up working with us?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
I grew up in the Wreyvian capital[,] but I[N]
never liked it.[.6] That's why I prefer working[N]
as a scout.[.6] You're always in nature.[AN]
Operating as a fancy messenger boy[N]
wasn't my first choice[,] but it pays and[N]
I get to explore the land.[AN][Clear]
Not so bad.[AN]

[MidRight]
That's how I ended up in the royal guard.[6N]
My sister and I used to try and tame horses[N]
when we were kids back in Solas.[AN]
We'd leave the city and go out into the[N]
nearby forests.[.6] She was always better[N]
at it than I am.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
You have a sister?[.6] Does she work in[N]
the city guard[,] too?[AN]

[Pause]Mocha.[.6] Can you please stop repeating[N]

[OpenMidLeft]
Oh[,] sorry![.6] Bad habit[Beat] Captain Luca used[N]
to tell me all the time to repeat the[N]
lessons she told me.[AN]
She said it made it easier to remember[N]
things[,] especially in training.[6N]
Her words still echo in my heart.[AN]

[MidRight]
I've never worked under Captain Luca.[6N]
I hear she was a brave[,] stronghearted[N]
knight[,] and loyalist to the end.[AN][C]
A damn shame what happened to her.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
She taught me everything about aerial[N]
combat and making the most of what[N]
little we have here in the kingdom.[AN]
Can you believe that?[.6] Me?[.6] I'm just[N]
a humble girl from Altes.[.6] I never thought[N]
I'd reach such heights in the army.[AN][C]
She taught me that Aeterians are the enemy.[6N]
The Captain was a valorous[,] true knight![AN]

[MidRight]
