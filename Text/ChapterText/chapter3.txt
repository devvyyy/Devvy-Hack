Or are you lot ready to just lay down[AN]

[FFL]The Aeterian soldiers are approaching[,][N]
Captain.[.6] We need orders.[AN]

[ML]
So what I'm sayin' is we shake the grit off[N]
our trousers and fight to our last breaths.[6N]
With honor and glory![AN]
Or would you rather we surrender and[N]
get executed on the same spear?[AN]

[FR]
I really don't get paid enough[N]
for this[,] Captain.

We're approaching the outer front of Northelm[,][N]
Wreyvine's capital city.[.6] We shouldn't be much[N]
further from the fray[,][AN]
Castle Wreyvine lies beyond these walls.[AN]

[R]
I've scouted ahead[,] sir.[.6] As expected[,][N]
there seems to be a skirmish at the outer[N]
front--[.4]the city square of Northelm.[AN]

[FR][LoadMocha]
There they are![.6] It looks less like a[N]
skirmish than a decimation.[6n]
Your orders[,] sir?[AN]

[R]
There's a lot of Aeterian soldiers.[6n]
We don't know who their leader is or[n]
what their strategy is.[an]
I strongly advise we split up our forces.[an]

Eisner[,] you never reported back[,][N]

Right. I was supposed to report back[,][N]

with Captain Stroganoff.[AN]
My sincerest apologies[,] Captain Brudet.[AN]

And you[Beat] You must be the famed Ulrich.[.6][N]
The knights of Wreyvine sing much praise of you.[.6][N]
I never thought I would ever meet you face-to-face.[AN]
I am Captain Anadama Brudet of the Wreyvian army.[N]
Like my mother and her father[,] the title of[N]
Captain for our aerial forces is my duty.[AN]

[FL]
It's a pleasure to meet you[,] Captain Brudet[,][N]
as former Lieutenant Ulrich.[.6] Let's leave it at that.[AN]

[MR]
Unfortunately[,] I bear dire news. The holy[N]
guard at the southern border of Northelm is[N]
in need of reinforcements.[AN]

[L]
The southern border? Aw[,] the abandoned outpost?[6N]
Are the Aeterians usin' it as a sort of hideout?[AN]

[MR]
Precisely.[.6] The Aeterian soldiers made[N]
their way there a mere three days prior[,][N]
and began to transport soldiers.[AN]
They're using the fortress as a bolthold[N]
for soldiers to arrive.[AN]

[FL]
Thank you[,] Captain. We will make our way[N]
over to the border fortress at once.[AN]
