Raial[,] a moment of your time.[AN]

[MR]
As if my time wasn't already taken[N]
up by you[,] Graham.[6N]
What is it?[AN]

[ML]
The map.[.6] We walk near the edge.[.6][N]
Another day like this and I believe[N]
we lose the trail entirely.[AN]
We have one shot to secure ground in[N]
the kingdom.[.6] If the Emperor gets wind[N]
of our position[,] our road is ruin.[AN]

I'm really hopin' those knights[N]
were telling the truth.[.6] If we arrive[N]

[FL]
You're in luck,[.4] cause the scouting[N]
party just returned.[.6] We found it,[4N]
along with people inside it.[AN]

[MR]
You're sure?[AN]

[FL]
A hundred percent.[.6] There are torchlights[N]
outside.[.6] I can hear and see ballistae[N]
fire off into the distance.[AN]
A group's definitely dug in.[.6][N]
Could be brigands[,] could be the royal[N]
survivors we're looking for.[AN][C]
Hell[,] it could even be both.[AN]

[L]
Do you have an estimate of their numbers?[6N]
We cannot proceed until everything is[N]
accounted for.[AN]

[FL]
Hard to tell[,] maybe a couple dozen?[6N]
But I can assure you that this group is[N]
disciplined.[.6] They're a quiet bunch.[AN][C]
Sentries take turns.[AN]

[MR]
Seems like we're on the right track[N]
if they're smart enough to shut up[N]
and keep out of the Emperor's eyes.[AN]

[FL]
They're watching the valley.[6N]
Their position is fortified[,] and[N]
I assume pretty secure.[AN]
I overheard something:[.4] their party[N]
is scouring the nearby area,[4N]
searching for missing men.[AN]

[MR]
Don't know who else it could[N]
possibly be.[.6] It's about time we[N]

An alliance[Beat] is of the utmost import.[AN]
As I said before,[.4] we are not your enemy[N]

Rather,[.4] we have a mutual foe.[AN]
We wish to join hands with your forces,[4N]

I want to trust you,[.4] messenger,[.4] but[N]

[MR]
Ser,[.4] if returning your captive men[N]
is not enough,[.4] we can arrange[Beat][AN]

[FL]
It was espionage and deceit that[N]
drilled holes into Wreyvine's steel[N]

But with Lord Gorlois still holed[N]

For all we know,[.4] they might not[N]
even have Lord Reinier at all.[AN]

If battle is deemed necessary,[N]
our search parties should be[N]

it should be easy to catch[N]

This is by far one of the[N]
most audacious things I've[N]
ever heard.[.6] Absolutely not.[AN]

[MR]
Hey,[.4] don't shoot the courier.[N]
This ain't coming from my mouth.[AN]

[ML]
I don't know how you found us,[N]
but you've got some guts waltzing[N]
up to us the way you did.[AN]

[CSS]
[MoveLeft]

[FL][Wegman]
Stand down,[.4] Gerolf.[.6] With Lord[N]
Gorlois still absent,[.4] Rick's[N]
the one in command here.[AN]

[L]
As you say.[.6] Pardon me.[AN]

[CSS]
[FL][CF][Ulrich][MoveLeft]
[Beat]So if I understand properly,[.4] your[N]
Liberation Army's master is currently[N]
holding the Third Division's survivors[AN]
as hostages,[.4] and wishes to meet[N]
with our leaders to negotiate?[AN]

[MR]
More or less.[.6] The Reverend[N]
is a very persuasive man,[N]
if you understand me.[AN]

[L]
And why should we trust that[N]
this is anything but a trap?[AN]
The Emperor has been doggedly[N]
hunting us for months now,[AN]
hoping to blot us out for good.[AN]
What's to say this isn't just a ploy[N]
to finally bring that into reality?[AN]

[MR]
Hmm,[.4] how should I put it?[N]
We may be Aeterian,[.4] but we've got[N]
no quarrel with you kingdom boys.[AN]
The Empire's done us wrong just as[N]
they've done you,[.4] you know?[AN]
As for this hostage matter[Beat][AN]
the Reverend is simply a man who[N]
ensures he gets what he wants.[AN]

[FL]
No quarrel,[.4] huh?[.6] Hah![AN]
If this is how you guys treat your[N]
"acquaintances",[.4] I shudder to think[N]
of how you see your enemies.[AN]

[L]
I see where this is going now.[AN]
This Reverend really wants to[N]
get us out in the open with him.[AN]
Enough that he's willing to hang[N]
Lord Reinier's life over our heads.[AN]
To what end,[.4] dare I ask?[AN]

[MR]
I wasn't told a thing,[.4] Ser.[N]
I'm on a need-to-know basis.[AN]

[CSS]
[FL][CF][Gerolf][MoveLeft]
Listen,[.4] pal,[.4] I can't help but feel[N]
like there's something awfully[N]
fishy about this business.[AN]
You're asking us to come out of[N]
hiding and expose ourselves--[.4][N]
or worse.[.6] And for what end?[AN]

[L][Ulrich]
My thoughts exactly,[.4] Ser Gerolf.[AN]
And how do we know that they[N]
actually have Lord Reinier and[AN]
the others with their group?[CloseEyes][AN]
If your words are truly honest,[N]
bring your group to Fort Arkstad[AN]
as soon as you possibly can.[OpenEyes][AN]
I would like to see my lost men[N]
within your ranks with my own[AN]
two eyes,[.4] messenger.[AN]
After that,[.4] we can discuss.[AN]

[FL]
Ulrich,[.4] are you sure--[.4][AN]

[L]
Elias,[.4] please trust me.[AN]
Are those acceptable terms?[AN]

[MR]
They are.[.6] I'll tell the Reverend[N]
immediately.[.6] Thank you.[AN]

[MoveFarFarRight][CF]

[L]
Hmph.[.6] What perfect timing.[AN]
The Third Division falls back into our[N]
laps,[.4] just as all our forces are spread[AN]
thin and far searching for them.[AN]

[FL]
Inviting an army of what might[N]
be foes straight to our door[Beat][N]
What are you thinking,[.4] Ulrich?[AN]
If word gets out,[.4] and our[N]
location reaches the ears of[N]
the Emperor or the Trinity[Beat][AN]

[L]
Our search parties should be[N]
coming back soon,[.4] am I correct?[AN]
With their return,[.4] it will be easy[AN]
to catch the enemy in a pincer attack.[AN]
Once that happens,[.4] we can easily[N]
retrieve the survivors of the Third[AN]
Division and pull them to safety.[AN]

[MR][Gerolf]
So you don't mean to play along[N]
in the slightest,[.4] Ulrich?[.6] Nice.[AN]

[L]
Why would I?[.6] They clearly want[N]
something out of us.[.6] So let's[N]
engage them on our terms.[AN]
Not theirs.[AN]

[FL]
[Beat]I don't like this,[.4] chum.[.6] We're[N]
really risking Lord Reinier's[N]
safety on a gambit like this?[AN]
But with Lord Gorlois still holed[N]
up with his crows,[.4] I suppose[N]
it's ultimately your call.[AN]
That messenger said that they[N]
weren't Imperials,[.4] but do you[N]
actually believe him?[AN]

[MR]
Wouldn't take much for Imps to[N]
disguise themselves as a band[N]
of brigands or vagabonds.[AN]
And anyone can call themselves[N]
a "liberation army".[.6] Words alone[N]
don't mean anything,[.4] do they?[AN]

[FL]
He claimed they were also[N]
against the Emperor,[.4] but[N]
they sure don't seem friendly.[AN]
Not when he's holding the[N]
lives of Reinier and Klavdia[N]
over our heads.[AN]

[L]
Well,[.4] there's no time to lose.[AN]
Rally the troops to arms.[AN]
Once they arrive,[.4] we'll strike[AN]
and retrieve our lost men.[AN]

You've all lost too much to shake[N]
hands with the enemy just because[N]
it's convenient,[.4] am I right?[AN]
And trust doesn't come cheap.[6N]
We're enemies,[.4] and not just in title.[6N]
Hell,[.4] even I'm unsure about this.[AN]

[L]
[Beat][AN]

[R]
Listen.[.6] We're not here to score points or[N]
hold hands.[.6] We're leaderless,[.4] cornered,[.4][N]
and dare I say?[.6] Maybe even desperate.[AN]
[Beat]Just like you.[AN]

[FL][CloseEyes]
[Beat][AN]

[R][OpenEyes]
But that's why this alliance matters.[.6] We're[N]
both down to scraps,[.4] but if we combine what[N]
we've got,[.4] we're not out of the fight.[AN]

[L]
What happens if we win,[.4] then?[6N]
Will you turn your eyes to the[N]
Wreyvian throne,[.4] just as well?[AN]

[FR]
We care not for any throne but Aeteria's.[N]
After we win,[.4] we help you rebuild your[N]
kingdom and restore peace to this land.[AN]
Nothing more.[AN]

[L]
That,[.4] right there,[.4] is what I was[N]
waiting to hear[Beat] the words you[N]
folk seemed afraid to say.[AN]

[FR]
[Beat][AN]

[L]
If we are to be allies,[.4] we must trust[N]
each other enough to speak our mind.[N]
Tongues dancing like fireflies benefits[AN]
no one.[.6] Not at this point,[.4] at least.[AN]

[R]
He's just angry,[.4] Lord Gorlois.[.6] He's tired[N]
of always being stuck with a hand that's[N]
two cards short of what we need to win.[AN][CloseEyes]
Frankly,[.4] I can sympathize.[.6] Feels like[N]
all we've been doing is playing a[N]
five-man game with four guys.[AN]

[FR][OpenEyes]
Forgive me,[.4] Lord Gorlois.[.6] I am[N]
simply[Beat] a cautious man by nature.[N]
I do not enjoy speaking too freely.[AN]
But still,[.4] you should know by now[N]
that it takes power to right a wrong.[N]
Power beyond a single man or group.[AN]
If we unite and join hands[Beat] if we[N]
stand side by side as one against the[N]
tyrant looming over our heads[Beat][AN]
We can make this right again.[AN]

[L][CloseEyes]
[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]
Very well.[AN]

[L][GorloisBird]
An alliance![.6] An alliance![N]
Two halves as one![AN]

[FL][MoveFL]  

[FL]
What?[AN]

[L]
Is something the matter,[.4] Lieutenant?[AN]

[FL]
No,[.4] nothing.[.6] I'd just[Beat] imagined you[N]
to be a more vocal opponent[N]
to this arrangement,[.4] Lord Gorlois.[AN]
If I may speak in earnest[Beat] the loss[N]
of His Majesty made you a bitter man.[N]
Your loathing towards the Imperials[AN]
dwarfed even General Klavdia's.[N]
To say nothing of the day the[N]
palace fell,[CloseEyes] when you[Beat][AN]

[L][OpenEyes]
Not a day passes that I do not[N]
grieve for His Majesty,[.4] Ulrich.[N]
Not a day.[AN]
And even now,[.4] looking upon[N]
these velvet colors,[.4] I feel red-[N]
hot scorn rising in my throat.[AN][CloseEyes]

[FR]
[Beat][AN]

[FL][OpenEyes]
And yet you would so readily agree[N]
to their proposal,[.4] Lord Gorlois?[.6] Even[N]
after their stunt with the prisoners?[AN]
It is what I would have done,[.4] but you[Beat][N]
you are certainly not me.[AN]

[L]
What choice do we have,[.4] Lieutenant?[N]
They are right[Beat] we cannot stand alone.[N]
Not in the condition we are now.[AN]
And I[Beat] I am tired.[.6] The months have[N]
been too long,[.4] and the hate burning in[N]
my bones has left my soul charred.[AN]
If Ideon is to find true peace[Beat] something[N]
must change.[.6] And if the Iron Tusks have[N]
decided to bestow that opportunity to us[Beat][AN]
it falls upon our shoulders--[.4]Wreyvian[N]
shoulders--[.4]to bring that change to light.[N]
Regardless of my personal feelings.[AN]

[FL]
Change,[.4] huh[Beat]?[AN]

[L]
These past months have brought much[N]
pain to the people of Wreyvine,[.4] and[N]
many are happy to point fingers at[AN]
Aeteria without any further thought.[N]
Even I am guilty of this,[.4] sometimes.[N]
But I am trying[Beat] trying to be better.[AN]
To be more than my scars alone.[AN]

[R]
Yeah[Beat] I understand that all too well.[N]
It's so easy to lose yourself in hate[N]
if you know your cause is just.[AN]

[L]
Many have been wronged on both[N]
sides of this long conflict.[N]
This,[.4] I am sure you understand.[AN]
But now is the time to stow those[N]
burning feelings for the culprit who[N]
tore these wounds into our skin.[AN]
He is the one at fault--[.4]not his[N]
homeland and all who inhabit her.[AN]

[FR]
I thank you,[.4] Lord Gorlois.[N]
Even in Aeteria,[.4] it was known that[N]
you were very close to the late king.[AN]
You have every right to be angry.[N]
Yet it takes resolve and vision to[N]
look past such a righteous rage,[AN]
even after all you've lost to this war.[AN]

[L]
As I said,[.4] I believe something must[N]
change for us to find peace[Beat][N]
and I see an opportunity for change.[AN]
If no one else in Wreyvine is willing[N]
to take that first step,[.4] then I will.[N]
And if I can,[.4] the kingdom can too.[AN]

[R]
So we're really doing this?[.6] Haaah[Beat][N]
After the last couple days,[.4] I'd almost[N]
forgotten what good news sounds like.[AN]

[L]
I shall address the kingdom's men[N]
and inform them of our coalition.[N]
I would like you to be there as well.[AN]
You are free to speak to your own[N]
soldiers beforehand if you wish.[AN]

[FR]
I shall look forward to a long and[N]
fruitful partnership,[.4] Lord Gorlois.[AN]

[R]
We won't let you down.[6N]
[Beat]Cool crow,[.4] by the way.[N]
Does he play nice?[AN]

[L][GorloisBird]
Two halves as one![.6] Gorlois,[.4] today[N]
is a day that will go down in history![AN]

[L][Gorlois]
Aohr is a raven,[.4] Raial.[.6] And while[N]
he is not fond of the color red[Beat][N]
He is open to change his mind.[AN]

[R][MoveR]
Hah![.6] Then when Aohr's mind does[N]
change,[.4] I'd love to get to know[N]
him a little better.[AN]

[FFR][Ulrich][MoveMidRight]
A word,[.4] Lord Gorlois.[AN]

[ML]
What is it,[.4] Lieutenant?[AN]

[MR]
I hope I did not speak out of line.[AN]

[ML]
No,[.4] no.[.6] Your confusion is fair.[AN]

[MR]
It's just[Beat] You were so paranoid[N]
for months after the palace's fall.[N]
Especially at me,[.4] and rightfully so.[AN]
When you chose me to serve as one[N]
of our order's lieutenants,[4N]
I was shocked that you were willing[AN]
to place your trust in me again[Beat][AN]

[ML]
And yet you accepted my trust[N]
and stepped up to fill your role.[N]
I could think of no better lieutenant.[AN]
In truth,[.4] Aohr and I were still wary[N]
of you at the time we chose you.[N]
But I wanted to remind myself what[AN]
it felt like to put my faith in my allies.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause][AN][C]
Where was this faith when you[N]
cast Affogato out of the kingdom?[AN]

[ML][CloseEyes]
Gone with His Majesty,[.4] like[N]
a torch-flame snuffed out.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[ML][OpenEyes]
I did not realize your mind still[N]
lingered on the scout.[.6] I am sorry,[N]
Lieutenant.[.6] Truly.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat]You have eyes all over Ideon.[6N]
May I ask if your flock has spotted him?[AN]

[ML]
Our eyes have yet to catch him[N]
since the day he left the palace.[AN]

[MR]
Not even a single trace?[6N]
Anything that could identify him?[AN]

[ML]
I am afraid not.[.6] He seems to have[N]
disappeared wholly.[.6] It is not dissimilar[N]
to the Apostle evading our sight.[AN][C]
But if you wish,[.4] I can search for him[N]
as well.[AN]

[MR]
Please do.[.6] I know it is much to ask[N]
with all you do for the kingdom,[4N]
but[Beat] Please do.[AN]

[ML]
It is not much at all.[.6] If I see him,[4N]
I will inform you.[.6] But before then[Beat][N]
we have another task ahead of us.[AN]
Let us speak to the kingdom.[AN]

[MR]
I can only pray that this goes[N]
without incident,[.4] but[Beat][AN]

[ML]
I doubt it.[.6] But we can still hope.[AN]

My brothers,[.4] my sisters[Beat] the path we have[N]
walked has been long and difficult.[.6] Looking[N]
out at all of your faces from here[Beat][AN]
it is more than clear that the invasion's[N]
scars still ache on all of our bodies.[N]
Wreyvine's hearth is resilient.[AN]
We have endured hardships that no man[N]

But we have merely endured for long enough.[AN]

[MR]
But all of you know in your hearts that this[N]
is not an endeavor we can handle alone.[N]
Not in our current condition,[.4] at least.[AN]
Only[Beat] we are far from alone.[.6] Standing[N]
beside me are the leaders of the Aeterian[N]
Liberation Army--[.4]enemies of the Emperor.[AN]
They have fought against the Imperial[N]
army,[.4] and rescued the Third Division's[N]
survivors from the Empire's clutches.[AN]
They want nothing more than the head of[N]
Emperor Selwyn as we do,[.4] and they are[N]
willing to contribute their men to our cause![AN]

Allying with the damned redslicks?![AN]

I always knew Lord Gorlois was eccentric.[N]

First off,[.4] I want to put a name to my face.[4N]
That way,[.4] you'll think of more than just[N]
[OpenQuote]Imperial scum" when you look at me.[AN]
The name's Raial,[.4] and I'm no noble.[6N]
Just an ordinary fighter like you lot,[.4] hoping[N]
to patch things up before they break further.[AN]
Frankly?[.6] You have every right to hate us.[.6][N]
To doubt me[,] even.[.6] But don't doubt[N]
the people behind me.[AN]
We've burned our bridges and chose this.[.6][N]
Not because it's easy--[.4]but because the[N]
cost of doing nothing is far worse![AN]
And hell,[.4] I know better than anyone that[N]
brotherhood is earned through fire--[.4]by[N]
standing together in the face of hardship.[AN]
So I'm more than ready to light the[N]

I am Reverend Malcolm Graham:[4N]
leader of the Noctum Order,[.4] and[N]
formerly of the Aeterian court.[AN]
And the day your king's throne[N]
turned blood-red was the beginning[N]
of the end for my companions.[AN]
Emperor Selwyn--[.4]he who was once[N]
merely Duke Omios--[.4]has proven[N]
himself an unworthy[,] senseless leader.[AN]
Brigandry has risen and those accursed[N]
magical spectres thrash about unchecked,[4N]
as he plugs his ears to his country's cries.[AN]
We are here to make things right--[.4][N]
to stop him before he sacrifices all of[N]
us like lambs on the altar of his ambitions.[AN]
I have seen Wreyvine's people with my[N]
own eyes.[.6] I have seen their fervor,[4N]
and the knightly spirit that guides them.[AN]
And when I look out at all of you,[.4] I see[N]
a crowd of men ready to do what must[N]
be done to bring about a better world.[AN]
Men with true drive,[.4] true grit[Beat] a true[N]
desire to enact change with their own[N]
two hands.[AN]
I am a man of the same mold.[.6] A man of[N]
all your hearts.[.6] So,[.4] will you join me,[4N]

Will you stand beside me at the gates[N]

I know that this may be[Beat] much to[N]

given the last few months.[AN]

you all tired of living like shrews?[AN]
Of scurrying from burrow to burrow,[4N]

We all have good reasons to hate.[AN]
So all I ask is that you shelve that[N]
hate long enough for us to climb[N]
out of the rut Aeteria's thrown us in![AN]

Wreyvine and Aeteria can walk the same road.[.6][N]
