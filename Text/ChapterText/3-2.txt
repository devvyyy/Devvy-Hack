[ML][Graham][MR][Raial]

[ML]
Raial[,] a moment of your time.[AN]

[MR]
As if my time wasn't already taken[N]
up by you[,] Malcolm.[6N]
What is it?[AN]

[ML]
The map.[.6] We walk near the edge.[.6][N]
Another day like this and I believe[N]
we lose the trail entirely.[AN]
We have one shot to secure ground in[N]
the kingdom.[.6] If the Emperor gets wind[N]
of our position[,] our road is ruin.[AN]

[MR]
You see this point on the map?[6N]
We don't even know if they came[N]
through here.[AN]
It's an abandoned fort[,] ain't it?[6N]
This place could be entirely empty[N]
for all we know.[AN]

[ML][MoveLeft]

[FFL][Verna][MoveFarLeft]

[FL]
It's not.[AN]

[MR]
You're sure?[AN]

[FL]
A hundred percent.[.6] There are torchlights[N]
outside.[.6] I can hear and see ballistae[N]
fire off into the distance.[AN]
A group's definitely dug in.[.6][N]
Could be brigands[,] could be the royal[N]
survivors we're looking for.[AN][C]
Hell[,] it could even be both.[AN]

[L]
Do you have an estimate of their numbers?[6N]
We cannot proceed until everything is[N]
accounted for.[AN]

[FL]
Hard to tell[,] maybe a couple dozen?[6N]
But I can assure you that this group is[N]
disciplined.[.6] They're a quiet bunch.[AN][C]
Sentries take turns.[AN]

[MR]
So[Beat] They must be knights or mercs if[N]
they're smart enough to shut up.[.6] Maybe[N]
they're laying low from the Emperor's eyes.[AN]

[FL]
They're watching the valley.[6N]
Their position is fortified[,] and[N]
I assume pretty secure.[AN]
I overheard something:[.4] this is their[N]
last night before they march towards[N]
a second location.[AN]

[L]
No army is coming down this road without[N]
being spotted.[.6] But if they fly the[N]
colors of Wreyvine[,] then we should move.[AN]

[MR]
We really moving forward with your[N]
[OpenQuote]diplomacy"[,] Graham?[.6] Then we parley.[AN]

[L]
We approach with about twelve.[6N]
No more.[.6] We need to show them that we[N]
are serious[,] but not a large threat.[AN]

[MR]
Hard to do when your Order consists of[N]
the mages they soil their pants[N]
over[,] hm?[AN]

[FL]
They're definitely gonna be jumpy.[6N]
I mean[,] are we sure they won't just[N]
kill us on sight?[AN]

[L]
No[,] that is the gambit.[.6] To make it clear[,][N]
this is our one shot.[.6] We cannot wait for[N]
the first light.[AN]

[ML][Wegman][MR][Ulrich]
[ML]
Phew.[.6] Even after that horde[,] I'd say[N]
supplies will hold another moon yet.[AN]

[MR]
The scouts haven't seen movement in days.[6N]
Isn't that disquieting to you?[AN]

[ML][MoveFarLeft]
[L][Klavdia]
There are trails.[.6] We saw boot prints by[N]
the southern ridge near the bridge.[6N]
We think they're raiders.[AN]

[MR][MoveFarRight]

[R][Gerolf]
Honestly[,] with how cold it's been getting[,][N]
I wouldn't be surprised.[.6] It feels[N]
colder and colder every week.[AN]
I hope we can take down those two[N]
before we freeze to death[,] that's[N]
for sure.[AN]

[L]
And still low on the upkeep[Beat][N]
Neither of them have been seen[,] despite[N]
our efforts.[AN]
Even Castle Vale is empty.[.6] Only[N]
the Consuls would know where our[N]
central figures are residing.[AN]

## Part3Chapter2Opening3
[3L]
[ML][Graham][MR][Raial]

[ML]
[Pause]Their banner flies Wreyvine's twin horns.[6N]
It is clear as day[,] Raial.[.6] We take[N]
no more chances in our maneuver.[AN]

[MR]
Who exactly are we approaching here?[6N]
Would be good to get a face to a name.[AN]

[ML]
Lieutenant Ulrich is leading their forces.[6N]
We aim for him.[AN]

[MR]
Heh[,] the Sun of Wreyvine?[.6] What bad luck.[AN]

[ML]
You speak as though you have crossed[N]
paths with him.[.6] What more can we[N]
gather about this battle?[AN]

[MR]
I mean[,] I've never met the guy[,] but[N]
I've heard all sorts of fancy stories.[6N]
Some good[,] some bad. [Pause]Some really bad.[AN]
If he's leading the front[,] then this'll[N]
be a rough one.[.6] It's just[Beat] He[N]
should be retired by now[,] no?[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]Something has been bothering me.[6N]
If I recall[,] he perished in the old war.[AN]

[MR]
Back from the grave[,] huh?[.6] Then I[N]
suppose we can't afford to underestimate[N]
the Wreyvian army after all this time.[AN]
We'll move out on my signal[,] Graham.[6N]
I trust that everything on your end[N]
is fine and dandy?[AN]

[ML]
We bring our tokens.[.6] If they do not[N]
listen to us[,] they must listen to them.[AN][CSS]
[ML][MoveLeft][MR][CF]
[FL][Raial]

[R][Brudet][FR][Stroganoff]

[R]
Fort Arkstad?[.6] That is where our allies have[N]
chosen?[.6] Are you certain that they're[N]
still gathered in there?[AN]

[FL]
It's our best bet for at least one[N]
cohort of royal knights.[AN]

[FR]
Ya know[,] I was just tellin' myself[,][N]
[OpenQuote]it sure'd be swell if we can get[N]
shot by our own men."[AN]

[R]
You were not.[AN]

[FR]
Okay[,] we're just gonna run in there?[6N]
You're practically beggin' for the royal[N]
army to bury y'all![AN]

[ML]
I trust the Reverend to handle logistics.[6N]
Buckle up[,] bluescarves[,] this is gonna[N]
be a tough ride![AN]

## Part3Chapter2Opening4
[3L]

[ML][Wegman][MR][Ulrich]

[MR]
Not many could've predicted how quickly[N]
it all unraveled[,] huh?[.6] We lost so many[,][N]
we lost the king[,] and I lost[Beat][AN]

[ML]
That funeral really was something.[.6N]
I've never seen the palace courtyard[N]
so quiet before.[AN]

[MR]
Even with the Empire marching in[,][N]
it felt more like a quiet end than a[N]
victory for them.[AN]

[ML]
Eh[,] it was the last thread of dignity for us.[6N]
Not that the Empire cared.[.6] They just wanted[N]
it over with with no fanfare.[AN]
It was all about control[,] and making sure they[N]
didn't stir up more unrest.[6N] But[Beat][N]
We knew what it really meant.[AN]

[MR]
The Emperor is such an enigma.[6N]
Never shows his hand.[AN]

[ML]
Or face[,] apparently.[.6] Or really anything.[6N]
Empress Zoria was nothing like this[N]
shadow ruler.[AN]

[MR]
I'm more confused on the Emperor's orders.[6N]
After the ore tithes began[,] the Consuls[N]
began their rule over the kingdom.[AN]
Us knights are split apart;[.4] Gorlois'[N]
men and the other captains have their[N]
own scattered forces.[AN][C]
Where could the empire's resources[N]
possibly be going?[AN]

[ML]
Probably to the Emperor[,] huh?[.6][N]
Selwyn's probably commissioned a grand[N]
throne by now.[AN]

[MR]
Perhaps the Consuls are pulling the strings.[6N]
He's just keeping quiet to maintain[N]
his grip on Ideon.[AN][CSS][MoveRight]

[FR][Soldier]
Everyone[,] hostiles have been sighted.[6N]
And[Beat] And[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Is everything alright?[AN]

[FR]
It's[Beat] It's the army that took over[N]
the border keep![.6] No banners furled[,] but[N]
we're sure they're Aeterian.[AN][C]
With them are Captain Brudet and[N]
Stroganoff.[.6] We are unsure on how to[N]
approach this.[AN]

[ML]
Could they be held as hostages?[6N]
There's no way they've finally decided to[N]
turn their blades[Beat][AN]

[R]
The immediate threat is the Aeterian army[,][N]
no matter their specific allegiance.[6N]
We have to intercept them.[AN]

## Part3Chapter2Opening5
[3L]

[FL][Klavdia][L][Ulrich]

[FL]
A commander leads them even if they[N]
don't fly the Imperial serpi.[6N]
The woman with the broadaxe.[AN]

[L]
Perhaps they're deserters from the empire[N]
with no other choice.[.6] But why are the[N]
captains among their ranks?[AN]

[FL]
This could easily be a trap.[6N]
I'm willing to gamble that they[N]
want us dead for now.[AN]

[L]
Let's hear them out[,] first.[6N]
Even with our new recruits[,] we're[N]
dwindling in numbers.[AN]

[FL]
If they open with words[,] then we'll see.[6N]
Lieutenant[,] I need you to stay in position.[6N]
Secure the vanguard.[AN]

[L]
Got it.[.6] And what if they open with arrows?[AN]

[FL]
Then we respond with ten[,] Lieutenant.[.6][N]
Come on[,] let's greet our guests![AN]

[X]


## Part3Chapter2Opening6
[3L]

[R][Graham][FR][Raial]

[FR]
Psst.[.6] They're watching us.[6N]
They know we're here[,] Graham.[AN]

[R]
Perhaps this was not in the cards[,][N]
but if we show ourselves[,] we can[N]
quickly demonstrate trust.[AN]

[ML][Verna]
There's a half-collapsed wall they use as[N]
a lookout post.[.6] That's our first[N]
contact point.[AN][CF]

[FR]
Do we know where this Ulrich is?[AN]

[R]
Not in this darkness.[.6] But I can hazard[N]
a guess that he'll either be in the front[N]
lines or leading them from behind.[AN][C]
Someone of his value would be kept to[N]
support from the backlines.[AN]

[FL][Stroganoff][L][Brudet]

[R]
Hey[,] bluescarves.[.6] Will you be able to earn[N]
us a parley?[AN]

[FL]
Seein' us alive should be enough[,] no?[6N]
They're not the skeptical bunch.[AN]

[L]
With the tensions of this war[,] I wouldn't[N]
be so sure.[.6] We've come to expect the[N]
most fiendish from the empire's forces.[AN]

[FL]
Lemme get a word in.[.6] I'm a hell[N]
of a smooth talker[,] ya know?[AN]

[L]
It's best if we don't turn our blades against[N]
our allies.[.6] That would cast more suspicion[N]
on us as traitors or hostages.[AN]

[FR][MoveRight]
Not to mention the dark's gonna make[N]
it hard to make anything out.[6N]
You two stay.[.6] We'll try talking.[AN]

[FR]
Agreed.[.6] Proper diplomacy is seldom given.[6N]
We hold the cards[,] all we need to do is[N]
use what we have to our advantage.[AN]

[L]
And[Beat] Just a trite warning.[6N]
If you take the life of any Wreyvian[,][N]
I will not hesitate to cut you all down.[AN]

[R]
Blunt edge of the axe[,] got it.[6N]
Now try to keep up![AN]

[X]

## Part3Chapter2Opening7
# first move
[3L]
Captain[,] we need them to understand our position.[AN]
Do your[Beat] war cry with that tenor of[N]
yours while I shut my ears.[AN]

Heh[,] ye can always count on me[,] Ana.[AN]
Ahem[Beat][AN]

## Part3Chapter2Ending1
# ill uhhh write this later, too much dialogue lol
[3L]

[R][Graham][FR][Raial]

[R]
We--[AN][CSS]

[FR][MoveRight]
Let me.[AN][CSS]
We are the Liberation Army.[6N]
We've seen what the Apostle and the Emperor[N]
have done.[.6] We have to stop it.[AN]





Prove your loyalty by gathering your allies[N]
and fighting with us.[.6] This upcoming battle[N]
will be pivotal,[AN]
yet our numbers alone won't make it.
