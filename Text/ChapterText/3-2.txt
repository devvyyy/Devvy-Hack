[ML]
Raial[,] a moment of your time.[AN]

[MR]
As if my time wasn't already taken[N]
up by you[,] Graham.[6N]
What is it?[AN]

[ML]
The map.[.6] We walk near the edge.[.6][N]
Another day like this and I believe[N]
we lose the trail entirely.[AN]
We have one shot to secure ground in[N]
the kingdom.[.6] If the Emperor gets wind[N]
of our position[,] our road is ruin.[AN]

[MR]
You see this point on the map?[6N]
We don't even know if they came[N]
through here.[AN]
It's an abandoned fort[,] ain't it?[6N]
This place could be entirely empty[N]
for all we know.[AN]

[ML][MoveLeft]

[FFL][Verna][MoveFarLeft]

[FL]
It's not.[AN]

[MR]
You're sure?[AN]

[FL]
A hundred percent.[.6] There are torchlights[N]
outside.[.6] I can hear and see ballistae[N]
fire off into the distance.[AN]
A group's definitely dug in.[.6][N]
Could be brigands[,] could be the royal[N]
survivors we're looking for.[AN][C]
Hell[,] it could even be both.[AN]

[L]
Do you have an estimate of their numbers?[6N]
We cannot proceed until everything is[N]
accounted for.[AN]

[FL]
Hard to tell[,] maybe a couple dozen?[6N]
But I can assure you that this group is[N]
disciplined.[.6] They're a quiet bunch.[AN][C]
Sentries take turns.[AN]

[MR]
So[Beat] They must be knights or mercs if[N]
they're smart enough to shut up.[.6] Maybe[N]
they're laying low from the Emperor's eyes.[AN]

[FL]
They're watching the valley.[6N]
Their position is fortified[,] and[N]
I assume pretty secure.[AN]
I overheard something:[.4] this is their[N]
last night before they march towards[N]
a second location.[AN]

[L]
No army is coming down this road without[N]
being spotted.[.6] But if they fly the[N]
colors of Wreyvine[,] then we should move.[AN]

[MR]
We really moving forward with your[N]
[OpenQuote]diplomacy"[,] Graham?[.6] Then we parley.[AN]

[L]
We approach with about twelve.[6N]
No more.[.6] We need to show them that we[N]
are serious[,] but not a large threat.[AN]

[MR]
Hard to do when your Order consists of[N]
the mages they soil their pants[N]
over[,] hm?[AN]

[FL]
They're definitely gonna be jumpy.[6N]
I mean[,] are we sure they won't just[N]
kill us on sight?[AN]

[L]
No[,] that is the gambit.[.6] To make it clear[,][N]
this is our one shot.[.6] We cannot wait for[N]
the first light.[AN]

[ML]
Phew.[.6] Even after that horde[,] I'd say[N]
supplies will hold another moon yet.[AN]

[MR]
The scouts haven't seen movement in days.[6N]
Isn't that disquieting to you?[AN]

[ML][MoveFarLeft]
[L][Klavdia]
There are trails.[.6] We saw boot prints by[N]
the southern ridge near the bridge.[6N]
We think they're raiders.[AN]

[MR][MoveFarRight]

[R][Gerolf]
Honestly[,] with how cold it's been getting[,][N]
I wouldn't be surprised.[.6] It feels[N]
colder and colder every week.[AN]
I hope we can take down those two[N]
before we freeze to death[,] that's[N]
for sure.[AN]

[L]
And still low on the upkeep[Beat][N]
Neither of them have been seen[,] despite[N]
our efforts.[AN]
Even Castle Vale--[.4]the Bastion[,] is empty.[.6][N]
Only the Consuls would know where our[N]
central figures are residing.[AN]

It is clear as day[,] Raial.[.6] We take[N]
no more chances in our maneuver.[AN]

[MR]
Who exactly are we approaching here?[6N]
Would be good to get a face to a name.[AN]

[ML]
Lieutenant Ulrich is leading their forces.[6N]
We aim for him.[AN]

[MR]
Heh[,] the Sun of Wreyvine?[.6] What bad luck.[AN]

[ML]
You speak as though you have crossed[N]
paths with him.[.6] What more can we[N]
gather about this battle?[AN]

[MR]
I mean[,] I've never met the guy[,] but[N]
I've heard all sorts of fancy stories.[6N]
Some good[,] some bad.[.6] [Pause]Some really bad.[AN]
If he's leading the front[,] then this'll[N]
be a rough one.[.6] It's just[Beat] He[N]
should be retired by now[,] no?[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]Something has been bothering me.[6N]
If I recall[,] he perished in the old war.[AN]

[MR]
Back from the grave[,] huh?[.6] Then I[N]
suppose we can't afford to underestimate[N]
the Wreyvian army after all this time.[AN]
We'll move out on my signal[,] Graham.[6N]
I trust that everything on your end[N]
is fine and dandy?[AN]

[ML]
We bring our tokens.[.6] If they do not[N]
listen to us[,] they must listen to them.[AN][CSS]
[ML][MoveLeft][MR][CF]
[FL][Raial]

[R][Brudet][FR][Stroganoff]

[R]
Fort Arkstad?[.6] That is where our allies have[N]
chosen?[.6] Are you certain that they're[N]
still gathered in there?[AN]

[FL]
It's our best bet for at least one[N]
cohort of royal knights.[AN]

[FR]
Ya know[,] I was just tellin' myself[,][N]
[OpenQuote]it sure'd be swell if we can get[N]
shot by our own men."[AN]

[R]
You were not.[AN]

[FR]
Okay[,] we're just gonna run in there?[6N]
You're practically beggin' for the royal[N]
army to bury y'all![AN]

[ML]
I trust the Reverend to handle logistics.[6N]
Buckle up[,] bluescarves[,] this is gonna[N]
be a tough ride![AN]

[ML][Wegman][MR][Ulrich]

[MR]
Not many could've predicted how quickly[N]
it all unraveled[,] huh?[.6] We lost so many[,][N]
we lost the king[,] and I lost[Beat][AN]

[ML]
That funeral really was something.[.6N]
I've never seen the palace courtyard[N]
so quiet before.[AN]

[MR]
Even with the Empire marching in[,][N]
it felt more like a quiet end than a[N]
victory for them.[AN]

[ML]
Eh[,] it was the last thread of dignity for us.[6N]
Not that the Empire cared.[.6] They just wanted[N]
it over with with no fanfare.[AN]
It was all about control[,] and making sure they[N]
didn't stir up more unrest.[6N] But[Beat][N]
We knew what it really meant.[AN]

[MR]
The Emperor is such an enigma.[6N]
Never shows his hand.[AN]

[ML]
Or face[,] apparently.[.6] Or really anything.[6N]
Empress Zoria was nothing like this[N]
shadow ruler.[AN]

[MR]
I'm more confused on the Emperor's orders.[6N]
After the ore tithes began[,] the Consuls[N]
began their rule over the kingdom.[AN]
Us knights are split apart;[.4] Gorlois'[N]
men and the other captains have their[N]
own scattered forces.[AN][C]
Where could the empire's resources[N]
possibly be going?[AN]

[ML]
Probably to the Emperor[,] huh?[.6][N]
Selwyn's probably commissioned a grand[N]
throne by now.[AN]

[MR]
Perhaps the Consuls are pulling the strings.[6N]
He's just keeping quiet to maintain[N]
his grip on Ideon.[AN][CSS][MoveRight]

[FR][Soldier]
Everyone[,] hostiles have been sighted.[6N]
And[Beat] And[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Is everything alright?[AN]

[FR]
It's[Beat] It's the army that took over[N]
the border keep![.6] No banners furled[,] but[N]
we're sure they're Aeterian.[AN][C]
With them are Captain Brudet and[N]
Stroganoff.[.6] We are unsure on how to[N]
approach this.[AN]

[ML]
Could they be held as hostages?[6N]
There's no way they've finally decided to[N]
turn their blades[Beat][AN]

[R]
The immediate threat is the Aeterian army[,][N]
no matter their specific allegiance.[6N]
We have to intercept them.[AN]

[FL][Klavdia][L][Ulrich]

[FL]
A commander leads them even if they[N]
don't fly the Imperial serpi.[6N]
The woman with the broadaxe.[AN]

[L]
Perhaps they're deserters from the empire[N]
with no other choice.[.6] But why are the[N]
captains among their ranks?[AN]

[FL]
This could easily be a trap.[6N]
I'm willing to gamble that they[N]
want us dead for now.[AN]

[L]
Let's hear them out[,] first.[6N]
Even with our new recruits[,] we're[N]
dwindling in numbers.[AN]

[FL]
If they open with words[,] then we'll see.[6N]
Lieutenant[,] I need you to stay in position.[6N]
Secure the vanguard.[AN]

[L]
Got it.[.6] And what if they open with arrows?[AN]

[FL]
Then we respond with ten[,] Lieutenant.[.6][N]
Come on[,] let's greet our guests![AN]

[R][Graham][FR][Raial]

[FR]
Psst.[.6] They're watching us.[6N]
They know we're here[,] Graham.[AN]

[R]
Perhaps this was not in the cards[,][N]
but if we show ourselves[,] we can[N]
quickly demonstrate trust.[AN]

[ML][Verna]
There's a half-collapsed wall they use as[N]
a lookout post.[.6] That's our first[N]
contact point.[AN][CF]

[FR]
Do we know where this Ulrich is?[AN]

[R]
Not in this darkness.[.6] But I can hazard[N]
a guess that he'll either be in the front[N]
lines or leading them from behind.[AN][C]
Someone of his value would be kept to[N]
support from the backlines.[AN]

[FL][Stroganoff][L][Brudet]

[R]
Hey[,] bluescarves.[.6] Will you be able to earn[N]
us a parley?[AN]

[FL]
Seein' us alive should be enough[,] no?[6N]
They're not the skeptical bunch.[AN]

[L]
With the tensions of this war[,] I wouldn't[N]
be so sure.[.6] We've come to expect the[N]
most fiendish from the empire's forces.[AN]

[FL]
Lemme get a word in.[.6] I'm a hell[N]
of a smooth talker[,] ya know?[AN]

[L]
It's best if we don't turn our blades against[N]
our allies.[.6] That would cast more suspicion[N]
on us as traitors or hostages.[AN]

[FR][MoveRight]
Not to mention the dark's gonna make[N]
it hard to make anything out.[6N]
You two stay.[.6] We'll try talking.[AN]

[FR]
Agreed.[.6] Proper diplomacy is seldom given.[6N]
We hold the cards[,] all we need to do is[N]
use what we have to our advantage.[AN]

[L]
And[Beat] Just a trite warning.[6N]
If you take the life of any Wreyvian[,][N]
I will not hesitate to cut you all down.[AN]

[R]
Blunt edge of the axe[,] got it.[6N]
Now try to keep up![AN]

What's up with you[,] Lieutenant?[6N]
I don't know about you[,] but I still[N]
see hostiles all across the snow.[AN]
I'm not lowering my sword until[N]
all threats have been eliminated.[6N]
Wasn't that the plan?[AN]

[ML]
Are they still hostiles in your eyes[,][N]
even after they brought our lost[N]
brothers back to us?[AN]
They have done us a great favor.[6N]
The least we can do is hear[N]
out what they have to say.[AN]

[FL]
This looks like the most obvious ruse[N]
I've ever seen.[.6] A trap.[AN]

[ML][CloseEyes]
I know[,] and I understand your feelings[.6][N]
All of us have lost much at Aeteria's hand[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]

[FL]
Then pardon me for not wanting to[N]
expose my neck to the snake.[AN]
Why are we giving them a[N]
single ounce of our faith?[.6][AN]
I've already lost more than enough[N]
of my life thanks to Aeteria[,] and I[N]
don't care to give them anything more[AN]

[R][Klavdia]
They'll slaughter us all the moment[N]
we lay down our arms[,] Lieutenant.[.6][N]
Do you see?[AN]
There's a House Kyveli member right[AN]
there in their ranks.[.6] One who consorts[N]
with the most malignant of forces[Beat][AN]
A devil-worshipper like that could[N]
tears us all apart on a whim and[N]
we would have no defenses.[AN]
You'd willingly jeopardize the safety[N]
of Lord Gorlois[,] the one beacon of[N]
hope that remains for Wreyvine[Beat][AN]
Not to mention put the lives of[N]
our entire squadron at risk.[.6][N]
Are you quite sane[,] Captain?[AN]

I've never heard more nonsense come[N]
out of his mouth than I have today[AN]

Don't tell me you agree with this[N]
insanity too[,] General Wegman?[.6][N]

Look[,] Lord Reinier was part of[N]
Brudet's group too[.6] And he's[N]
nowhere to be found[,] is he?[AN][C]
How do we know we're not extending[N]
our hand to his killers[AN]

[FL]
Well[,] as much as my gut is telling[N]
me to keep my shield raised[Beat][OpenEyes][N]
I'm inclined to agree with Ulrich[Beat][AN]

[R]
What?[AN]

Wegman[Beat]?[AN]

[FR]
To think a man could grow soft[N]
in conditions like ours[Beat] You've[N]
done the impossible[,] Wegman[AN][C]
Consider me speechless[Beat][AN]

[CSS]
[FL][MoveLeft]
No[,] my friends[.6] Think about it.[.6][N]
Would a firebrand like Brudet ever[N]
bend her knee to Aeteria[AN]
Would she ever willingly fall[N]
in line alongside blades pointed[N]
at the Wreyvian crown?[AN]

[R]
[Beat]No[,] not in a century[AN]

[FR]
She would rather die than ever[N]
play a part in a farce like this.[AN]

WEGMAN
Now do you see[.6] If the King's Fang,[N]
the scourge of Aeteria herself,[N]
is standing by their side[Beat][AN]
then they must have something[N]
to say that's worth hearing[,] yes[AN]

BRUDET
And if she was brainwashed[AN]

ULRICH
[Beat]That goes both ways[,] Captain Brudet[.6][N]
We could have some new mage-mashing[N]
machine up our sleeves for all they know[.6][N]
They put their faith in us in trying to parley[AN]
It's the least we can do to do the same[.6][N]
I shall say this one last time[,] as an order:[N]
tell the men to stand down and lower[AN]
their arms[AN]
Negotiations shall begin[AN]

GEROLF
My tongue has never tasted such bitter[N]
disgust[,] Lieutenant.[AN]

I want both of you to accompany[N]
me to speak to their commanders.[.6][N]
Stay by my side[,] and do not act[AN]

You address Captain Ulrich of the[N]

As requested[,] we have agreed[N]

RAIAL
Captain Raial of the Aeterian[N]
Liberation Army[,] at your service[.6][N]
The man by my side is Graham.[AN]

ULRICH
Raial[,] hm?[.6][N]
I think I've heard tales of[N]
a mercenary captain by that name.[AN]
And this Graham is a member of[N]
the Aeterian court[,] judging by[N]
his choice of attire.[AN]

GRAHAM
*Was* a member.[.6] But that is all[N]
history now.[.6] We are no longer[N]
welcome in Aeteria.[AN]

ULRICH
[Beat][AN]

GRAHAM
We[,] and our companions[,] are[Beat][N]
dissatisfied[,] let's say[,] with the[N]
recent behaviors of the Emperor.[AN]
We thought it prudent to take[N]
matters into our own hands[.6][N]
Thus[,] we have been branded[AN]
as enemies of the empire[.6][N]
We had thought to forge a[N]
coalition[,] perhaps[,] with the[AN]
remnants of the Wreyvian army.[AN]

RAIAL
These guys were scheduled for a public[N]
execution at the border fort.[.6][N]
They're members of your company[,] correct?[AN]

There were others with them,[N]
including one Count Reinier.[.6][N]
Where is he?[AN]

RAIAL
[Beat]The executions were already[N]
underway when we arrived.[CloseEyes][.6][N]
These two are the only survivors.[OpenEyes][AN]

ULRICH
Klavdia.[.6][N]
Stroganoff.[.6][N]
Can you confirm or deny this?[AN]

KLAVDIA[CloseEyes]
She speaks the truth.[.6] Reinier's[N]
head was the first to roll.[.6][N]
Wreyvine lost a great man.[AN]

STROGANOFF
Shakes me to the core[,] it does.[.6][N]
Such a proud man[,] reduced to nothing[N]
just like that[Beat][AN]

ULRICH
I see[Beat] Then a proper funeral shall[N]
be arranged for him and the others[.6][N]
Tell me[,] though:[AN]
Both of you agreed[,] willingly[,] to join hands[N]
with this Aeterian army?[AN]

KLAVDIA[CloseEyes]
It fills my throat with bile,[4N]
knowing I stand shoulder to[N]
shoulder with Aeterian casters.[AN]
But[Beat] Raial and I spoke about[N]
a great many things[.6][N]
And I realized[Beat] that if Ideon is[AN]
truly going to change[Beat] [OpenEyes]perhaps[N]
drastic measures are required[Beat][AN]

STROGANOFF
Heh![.6][N]
Astonishin'[,] ain't it?[.6][N]
You can trust 'em or don't,[AN]
but I've seen 'em in action[N]
They mean business[,] and[N]
they certainly ain't kidding[AN]
'bout bein' against Selwyn.[AN]

Raial
Yeah![.6] You hear that?[.6] Strogy and I're[N]
gonna make Selwyn's head roll.[AN]

KLAVDIA
I can hardly believe the words[N]
that are coming out of my mouth.[.6][N]
But the times are desperate[,] and[AN]
our people have suffered enough[.6][N]
I want to end this farce.[.6][N]
I want to see the Emperor's head[AN]
roll[,] even if it means[Beat] this[AN]

ULRICH
I see.[.6][N]
Thank you[,] you two.[.6][N]
That seemed[Beat] genuine.[AN]

RAIAL
A sprinkle of unity goes a long way[,] Lieutenant.[.6][N]
Is that enough to prove that[AN]
we mean what we say?[.6][AN][C]
We share a common foe.[AN]

(GEROLF moves forwards on the map)

GEROLF
[Beat]Awfully suspicious[,] this is[.6][N]
Sure is convenient that Reinier's[N]
head was the one that rolled,[AN]
especially given how Aeteria[N]
went straight for our chain of[N]
command back in the invasion.[AN]
How funny it is that the one who[N]
died was one of the last beacons[N]
of Wreyvine that eluded them.[AN]

RAIAL
Look[,] we did the best we could[N]
but there was no possible way[N]
that we could've saved him[AN]
The executions had started just[N]
as we'd arrived at the fort![AN]

GRAHAM
Wreyvian[,] you continue to misunderstand[N]
your place.[.6] The way I see it[,] you[.6][N]
are in no position to negotiate.[AN]
Do you truly believe you can[N]
afford to turn down our forces?[.6][N]
Do you truly think your battered,[AN]
exhausted men can take on[N]
the might of the Emperor alone?[.6][N]
I saw the state of your army with my[AN]
own eyes on the battlefield today[.6][N]
You need us.[.6] We rescued your[N]
men and offered you our hand,[AN]
and you would dare turn us down?[AN]

RAIAL
Malcolm[,] what are you–[AN]

ULRICH
Is that a threat[,] Graham?[AN]

GRAHAM
I am simply making sure that[N]
you understand the situation[N]
clearly[,] with respect.[AN]
Or perhaps I should spell it[N]
out more explicitly for you,[4N]
Lieutenant Ulrich:[AN]
you'd best not reject our offer[AN]
if you value your men's lives or[N]
the future of Wreyvine.[AN]
