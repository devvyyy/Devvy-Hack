[ML]
Raial[,] a moment of your time.[AN]

[MR]
As if my time wasn't already taken[N]
up by you[,] Graham.[6N]
What is it?[AN]

[ML]
The map.[.6] We walk near the edge.[.6][N]
Another day like this and I believe[N]
we lose the trail entirely.[AN]
We have one shot to secure ground in[N]
the kingdom.[.6] If the Emperor gets wind[N]
of our position[,] our road is ruin.[AN]

[MR]
You see this point on the map?[6N]
We don't even know if they came[N]
through here.[AN]
It's an abandoned fort[,] ain't it?[6N]
This place could be entirely empty[N]
for all we know.[AN]

[ML][MoveLeft]

[FFL][Verna][MoveFarLeft]

[FL]
It's not.[AN]

[MR]
You're sure?[AN]

[FL]
A hundred percent.[.6] There are torchlights[N]
outside.[.6] I can hear and see ballistae[N]
fire off into the distance.[AN]
A group's definitely dug in.[.6][N]
Could be brigands[,] could be the royal[N]
survivors we're looking for.[AN][C]
Hell[,] it could even be both.[AN]

[L]
Do you have an estimate of their numbers?[6N]
We cannot proceed until everything is[N]
accounted for.[AN]

[FL]
Hard to tell[,] maybe a couple dozen?[6N]
But I can assure you that this group is[N]
disciplined.[.6] They're a quiet bunch.[AN][C]
Sentries take turns.[AN]

[MR]
So[Beat] They must be knights or mercs if[N]
they're smart enough to shut up.[.6] Maybe[N]
they're laying low from the Emperor's eyes.[AN]

[FL]
They're watching the valley.[6N]
Their position is fortified[,] and[N]
I assume pretty secure.[AN]
I overheard something:[.4] this is their[N]
last night before they march towards[N]
a second location.[AN]

[L]
No army is coming down this road without[N]
being spotted.[.6] But if they fly the[N]
colors of Wreyvine[,] then we should move.[AN]

[MR]
We really moving forward with your[N]
[OpenQuote]diplomacy"[,] Graham?[.6] Then we parley.[AN]

[L]
We approach with about twelve.[6N]
No more.[.6] We need to show them that we[N]
are serious[,] but not a large threat.[AN]

[MR]
Hard to do when your Order consists of[N]
the mages they soil their pants[N]
over[,] hm?[AN]

[FL]
They're definitely gonna be jumpy.[6N]
I mean[,] are we sure they won't just[N]
kill us on sight?[AN]

[L]
No[,] that is the gambit.[.6] To make it clear[,][N]
this is our one shot.[.6] We cannot wait for[N]
the first light.[AN]

Phew.[.6] Even after that horde[,] I'd say[N]
supplies will hold another moon yet.[AN]

[MR]
The scouts haven't seen movement in days.[6N]
Isn't that disquieting to you?[AN]

[ML][MoveFarLeft]
[L][Klavdia]
There are trails.[.6] We saw boot prints by[N]
the southern ridge near the bridge.[6N]
We think they're raiders.[AN]

[MR][MoveFarRight]

[R][Gerolf]
Honestly[,] with how cold it's been getting[,][N]
I wouldn't be surprised.[.6] It feels[N]
colder and colder every week.[AN]
I hope we can take down those two[N]
before we freeze to death[,] that's[N]
for sure.[AN]

[L]
And still low on the upkeep[Beat][N]
Neither of them have been seen[,] despite[N]
our efforts.[AN]
Even Castle Vale--[.4]the Bastion[,] is empty.[.6][N]
Only the Consuls would know where our[N]
central figures are residing.[AN]

no more chances in our maneuver.[AN]

[MR]
Who exactly are we approaching here?[6N]
Would be good to get a face to a name.[AN]

[ML]
Lieutenant Ulrich is leading their forces.[6N]
We aim for him.[AN]

[MR]
Heh[,] the Sun of Wreyvine?[.6] What bad luck.[AN]

[ML]
You speak as though you have crossed[N]
paths with him.[.6] What more can we[N]
gather about this battle?[AN]

[MR]
I mean[,] I've never met the guy[,] but[N]
I've heard all sorts of fancy stories.[6N]
Some good[,] some bad.[.6] [Pause]Some really bad.[AN]
If he's leading the front[,] then this'll[N]
be a rough one.[.6] It's just[Beat] He[N]
should be retired by now[,] no?[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]Something has been bothering me.[6N]
If I recall[,] he perished in the old war.[AN]

[MR]
Back from the grave[,] huh?[.6] Then I[N]
suppose we can't afford to underestimate[N]
the Wreyvian army after all this time.[AN]
We'll move out on my signal[,] Graham.[6N]
I trust that everything on your end[N]
is fine and dandy?[AN]

We bring our tokens.[.6] If they do not[N]
listen to us[,] they must listen to them.[AN][CSS]

[R]
Fort Arkstad?[.6] That is where our allies have[N]
chosen?[.6] Are you certain that they're[N]
still gathered in there?[AN]

[FL]
It's our best bet for at least one[N]
cohort of royal knights.[AN]

[FR]
Ya know[,] I was just tellin' myself[,][N]
[OpenQuote]it sure'd be swell if we can get[N]
shot by our own men."[AN]

[R]
You were not.[AN]

[FR]
Okay[,] we're just gonna run in there?[6N]
You're practically beggin' for the royal[N]
army to bury y'all![AN]

I trust the Reverend to handle logistics.[6N]
Buckle up[,] bluescarves[,] this is gonna[N]
be a tough ride![AN]

[ML][Wegman][MR][Ulrich]

[MR]
Not many could've predicted how quickly[N]
it all unraveled[,] huh?[.6] We lost so many[,][N]
we lost the king[,] and I lost[Beat][AN]

[ML]
That funeral really was something.[.6N]
I've never seen the palace courtyard[N]
so quiet before.[AN]

[MR]
Even with the Empire marching in[,][N]
it felt more like a quiet end than a[N]
victory for them.[AN]

[ML]
Eh[,] it was the last thread of dignity for us.[6N]
Not that the Empire cared.[.6] They just wanted[N]
it over with with no fanfare.[AN]
It was all about control[,] and making sure they[N]
didn't stir up more unrest.[6N] But[Beat][N]
We knew what it really meant.[AN]

[MR]
The Emperor is such an enigma.[6N]
Never shows his hand.[AN]

[ML]
Or face[,] apparently.[.6] Or really anything.[6N]
Empress Zoria was nothing like this[N]
shadow ruler.[AN]

[MR]
I'm more confused on the Emperor's orders.[6N]
After the ore tithes began[,] the Consuls[N]
began their rule over the kingdom.[AN]
Us knights are split apart;[.4] Gorlois'[N]
men and the other captains have their[N]
own scattered forces.[AN][C]
Where could the empire's resources[N]
possibly be going?[AN]

[ML]
Probably to the Emperor[,] huh?[.6][N]
Selwyn's probably commissioned a grand[N]
throne by now.[AN]

[MR]
Perhaps the Consuls are pulling the strings.[6N]
He's just keeping quiet to maintain[N]
his grip on Ideon.[AN][CSS][MoveRight]

[FR][Soldier]
Everyone[,] hostiles have been sighted.[6N]
And[Beat] And[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Is everything alright?[AN]

[FR]
It's[Beat] It's the army that took over[N]
the border keep![.6] No banners furled[,] but[N]
we're sure they're Aeterian.[AN][C]
With them are Captain Brudet and[N]
Stroganoff.[.6] We are unsure on how to[N]
approach this.[AN]

[ML]
Could they be held as hostages?[6N]
There's no way they've finally decided to[N]
turn their blades[Beat][AN]

[R]
The immediate threat is the Aeterian army[,][N]
no matter their specific allegiance.[6N]
We have to intercept them.[AN]

A commander leads them even if they[N]
don't fly the Imperial serpi.[6N]
The woman with the broadaxe.[AN]

[L]
Perhaps they're deserters from the empire[N]
with no other choice.[.6] But why are the[N]
captains among their ranks?[AN]

[FL]
This could easily be a trap.[6N]
I'm willing to gamble that they[N]
want us dead for now.[AN]

[L]
Let's hear them out[,] first.[6N]
Even with our new recruits[,] we're[N]
dwindling in numbers.[AN]

[FL]
If they open with words[,] then we'll see.[6N]
Lieutenant[,] I need you to stay in position.[6N]
Secure the vanguard.[AN]

Got it.[.6] And what if they open with arrows?[AN]

Perhaps this was not in the cards[,][N]
but if we show ourselves[,] we can[N]
quickly demonstrate trust.[AN]

[ML][Verna]
There's a half-collapsed wall they use as[N]
a lookout post.[.6] That's our first[N]
contact point.[AN][CF]

[FR]
Do we know where this Ulrich is?[AN]

[R]
Not in this darkness.[.6] But I can hazard[N]
a guess that he'll either be in the front[N]
lines or leading them from behind.[AN][C]
Someone of his value would be kept to[N]
support from the backlines.[AN]

Hey[,] bluescarves.[.6] Will you be able to earn[N]

Seein' us alive should be enough[,] no?[6N]
They're not the skeptical bunch.[AN]

With the tensions of this war[,] I wouldn't[N]
be so sure.[.6] We've come to expect the[N]
most fiendish from the empire's forces.[AN]

[FL]
Lemme get a word in.[.6] I'm a hell[N]
of a smooth talker[,] ya know?[AN]

[L]
It's best if we don't turn our blades against[N]
our allies.[.6] That would cast more suspicion[N]
on us as traitors or hostages.[AN]
[CSS]

[FR][MoveRight]
Not to mention the dark's gonna make[N]
it hard to make anything out.[6N]
You two stay.[.6] We'll try talking.[AN]

[FR]
Agreed.[.6] Proper diplomacy is seldom given.[6N]
We hold the cards[,] all we need to do is[N]
use what we have to our advantage.[AN]

[L]
And[Beat] Just a trite warning.[6N]
If you take the life of any Wreyvian[,][N]
I will not hesitate to cut you all down.[AN]

Wasn't that the plan?[AN]

Are they still hostiles in your eyes[,][N]
even after they brought our lost[N]
brothers back to us?[AN]
They have done us a great favor.[6N]
The least we can do is hear[N]

[FR]
This looks like the most obvious ruse[N]
I've ever seen.[.6] A trap.[AN]

All of us have lost much at Aeteria's hand[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]

Why are we giving them even a single[AN]

I've already lost more than enough[N]
of my life thanks to Aeteria[,] and I[N]
don't care to give them anything more.[AN]

[R][Klavdia]
They'll slaughter us all the moment[N]
we lay down our arms[,] Lieutenant.[.6][N]
Do you see?[AN]
There's a House Kyveli member right[N]
there in their ranks.[.6] One who consorts[N]
with the most malignant of forces[Beat][AN]
A devil-worshipper like that could[N]
tears us all apart on a whim and[N]
we would have no defenses.[AN]
You'd willingly jeopardize the safety[N]

at the Wreyvian crown?[AN]

[Beat]No[,] not in a century.[AN]

She would rather die than ever play[N]
part in a farce like this.[AN]

Now do you see?[.6] If the King's Fang,[N]
the scourge of Aeteria herself,[N]
is standing by their side[Beat][AN]
then they must have something[N]
to say that's worth hearing[,] yes?[AN]

[R]
Hm.[AN]

That's what I think[,] anyways.[.6] But it's[N]
possible that they have some magical[N]
heeby-jeeby to get them in line.[AN]

[FL]
That goes both ways[,] Wegman.[.6][N]
We could have some new mage-mashing[N]
machine up our sleeves for all they know.[AN]
They put their faith in us in trying to parley.[6N]
It's the least we can do to do the same[,][N]
is it not?[AN]
I shall say this one last time[,] as an order:[4N]
tell the men to stand down and lower[N]
their arms.[AN][C]
Negotiations shall begin.[AN]

We lost our leader to the Consuls.[6N]
I know you lost a lot[Beat][AN]

[CSS]
[FR][CF][Gerolf]
You're damn right we did.[.6] Reinier was--[AN]

[L]
Reinier died before we could reach him.[.6][N]
That's the truth.[.6] And I'm sorry.[AN]

[FR]
Sorry's not worth much.[AN]

[L]
No[,] it's really not.[.6][N]
But I'm giving it anyway.[AN]

[R]
[Beat][AN]

[L]
Listen.[.6] We're not here to score points or[N]
hold hands.[.6] We're leaderless[,] cornered[,][N]
and dare I say?[.6] Maybe even desperate.[AN][C]
[Beat]Just like you.[AN]

[R]
[Beat][AN]

[L][MoveLeft]
But that can change![.6] We were enemies[N]
on opposite sides of the bridge[,] but none[N]
of this matters if we let Selwyn win.[AN]
That's why this alliance matters.[.6] We're both[N]
down to scraps[,] but if we combine what we've[N]
got[,] we're not out of the fight.[AN]

[CSS][FL][CF][Stroganoff]
She ain't wrong[,] y'know.[AN]

[CSS]
[FR][CF][Klavdia]
And we can't afford to keep fighting on[N]
two fronts[,] lest this war ends up the[N]
same way as the last[Beat][AN]

[L]
This all started because somebody on[N]
your side killed the Empress[,] but the[N]
past doesn't really matter.[AN]

[FR]
I still find that difficult to believe.[6N]
Still[,] nobody knows the truth anymore[N]
if Selwyn doesn't.[AN][C]
I fear the death of Empress Zoria will[N]
remain unsolved evermore.[AN][CSS]

[L]
We've seen what the Apostle and the Emperor[N]
have done.[.6] We have to stop it amd take[N]
Ideon back before it goes to shit.[AN]

[CSS]
[FR][CF][Gerolf]
Hold up a sec.[.6] What happens when we win?[.6][N]
You planning to shove your own regime[N]
down the kingdom[,] too?[AN]

[L]
No[,] General.[.6] If we win[,] we walk away.[6N]
We help you rebuild your kingdom[,] and we go back[N]
to cleaning up what's left of the Empire.[AN][C]
That's it.[AN]

[R]
And Graham[Beat] He speaks for your rebellion?[AN]

[L]
He's angry[,] Lieutenant.[.6] So am I[,] but we[N]
won't act out of line.[.6] You have my axe[N]
and my absolute loyalty.[AN]

[R]
Damn it[,] alright[Beat][AN][C]
Prove your loyalty by gathering your allies[N]
and fighting with us.[.6] This upcoming battle[N]
will be pivotal,[AN]
yet our numbers alone won't make it.[AN]

[FR]
If this is a trick[,] it's a damn elaborate one.[AN]

[FL]
We do not resort to falsehoods[,] General.[6N]
You have made the right decision.[AN]

[L]
That's a deal[,] then?[AN]

[L]
That's the plan.[.6] Let's get to work.[AN]

[FR]
Heh.[.6] Never thought I'd say this[,] but[Beat][N]
Good to be in bad company again.[AN]

[L]
We don't need to like each other.[.6][N]
We just need to win.[AN]
