No one was watching the rear flank.[AN]

So you return to us.[.6] I thought you were[Beat][N]    
I mean--[.4]I didn't think you were dead[,][N]
but I always hoped you would return.[AN][C]
I'm not sure what to say[,] except[Beat] thank you.[.6][N]  
You saved me again back there.[AN]

You bade me farewell[,] Lieutenant.[AN]

Will you truly return to us?[6N]
After all this time and everything[N]
that's happened?[AN]

I intend to.[.6] The Emperor must be stopped[N]
before Ideon freezes in an eternal winter.[AN]

You have a strange sense of timing.[6N]
A few seconds later and we would be mourning[N]
Lieutenant Ulrich out there.[AN]
Your previous vanishing act aside[,][N]
you are clearly committed[Beat][N]
you must be the Ashen Rider.[AN]

About time you showed up[,] cloak-boy.[6N]
You always show up after the dust settles[,][N]
don't you?[AN]

Not always.[AN]

You returned despite your exile.[AN]

Do you wish to cast me out again?[AN]

No[,] I believe we could work together.[6N]
We need to locate the Emperor[,] the[N]
Apostle[,] and any other key targets.[AN]
With your ability to always slip by[N]
unnoticed[,] you could prove to be a[N]
truly valuable soldier.[AN]

I wouldn't want to stand as your[N]
enemy[,] that's for sure.[AN]

Understood.[.6] I'll fight with you.[AN]

I'm happy to have you with us[N]
again[,] Affogato.[AN]

Likewise[,] Lieutenant.[AN]

You[Beat] You're the shrouded presence.[6N]
But how?[.6] How could you possibly[Beat][N]
No.[.6] Affogato[,] you bear the Harbinger's power![AN]

Right[,] Lord Gorlois.[AN]

[OpenQuote]Right"?[.6] This is another level of heresy[Beat][N]
The Harbinger is destined to bring forth[N]
eternal winter![AN]

But that's incorrect[,] milord.[AN][C]
[Pause]Because of the twin deities.[AN]
The struggle between Ideon's lands have[N]
tipped the divine balance between the[N]
Great Flame and the Serpent.[AN]
The warmth of the Great Flame strays[,][N]
and the world becomes colder.[6N]
The Harbinger only arrives in these[N]
times of ruin to bring balance back[N]
to these lands.[AN]

That's[Beat] impossible[Beat][N]
It has been written record for eons![AN]

It is the truth.[.6] I bear his mark.[AN]

I suppose it's not too far-fetched.[6N]
Something about the Harbinger's influence[N]
hides your presence[,] after all.[AN]

Your crows were unable to track me down[,][N]
milord.[.6] I'm not quite sure what this[N]
bodes exactly[,] but my steps remain unseen.[AN]

How long were you watching us?[6N]
Did you plan that rescue in advance?[AN]

I waited[,] but the Emperor spent too much[N]
time talking[,] so I released the arrow.[6N]
It's as simple as that.[AN][C]
I didn't want to reveal myself until[N]
I knew I wasn't in danger.[AN]

If I may say it plainly[,] Affogato[,][N]
you've seen the Empire's worst and[N]
have fought them alone.[AN]
But this war will take all of us.[6N]


Here's how it's gonna go down[,] Affogato.[6N]
We're gonna find where they're keeping[N]
Her Highness.[AN]
Then we're gonna break her out.[6N]
And then I'm going to find Selwyn[N]
and punch him in the face.[AN]
Maybe even twice.[.6] Or[Beat] three times.[6N]
And then I'm going to grab him by[N]
the horns and test out my new axe.[AN]

Okay.[AN]

Heh[,] you're the same as ever[,] huh?[6N]
Always unfazed by the world[Beat][AN]

If you intend to stay, we must coordinate.[6N]
Our resources are limited[,] but not[N]
fully nonexistent.[AN]


I can draw up a list of possible targets.[6N]
I will try to locate Princess Sylmeria[N]
and report back in time.[AN]
You should scout for a potential new[N]
base and resources to last the war.[6N]
We don't have much time.[AN]

Good.[.6] Then we're all aligned.[6N]
We must regroup and gather our strength.[6N]
And the world is ours.[AN]

Well then.[6N] Let's see what the world looks like
when we fight as one![AN]
