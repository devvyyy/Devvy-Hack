[L]
[Beat]The 7th Platoon's former scout.[AN]

[FR]
Sir.[AN]

[L]
So you return to us.[.6] I thought you were[Beat][N]
I mean--[.4]I didn't think you were dead[,][N]
but I always hoped you would return.[AN][C]
I'm not sure what to say[,] except[Beat] thank you.[.6][N]
You saved me again back there.[AN]

[FR]
You bade me farewell[,] Lieutenant.[AN]

[L]
Will you truly return to us?[6N]
After all this time and everything[N]
that's happened?[AN]

[FR]
I intend to.[.6] The Emperor must be stopped[N]
before Ideon meets its end.[AN]

[FL][Graham]
You have a strange sense of timing.[6N]
A few seconds later and we would be mourning[N]
Lieutenant Ulrich in this very forest.[AN]
Your previous vanishing act aside[,][N]
you are clearly committed[Beat] and you[N]
must be the Ashen Rider.[AN][CSS]
[CF]
[FL][Raial]
About time you showed up[,] cloak-boy.[6N]
You always just pop up after the dust settles[,][N]
don't you?[AN]

[FR]
Not always.[AN]

[L]
You returned despite your exile.[AN]

[FR]
Do you wish to cast me out again?[AN]

[L]
No[,] I believe we could work together.[6N]
We need to locate the Emperor[,] the[N]
Apostle[,] and any other key targets.[AN]
With your ability to always slip by[N]
unnoticed[,] you could prove to be a[N]
truly valuable soldier again.[AN]

[FL]
I know I wouldn't want to stand as your[N]
enemy[,] that's for sure.[AN]

[CSS]

[FR][MoveMidRight]
Then I'll fight with you for as long as[N]
this war rages.[.6] After that[,] we part ways.[AN]

[L][Smile]
I'm happy to have you with us[N]
again[,] Affogato.[AN]

[MR]
Likewise[,] Lieutenant.[AN][Smile][CSS]

[FL][CF][Gorlois]
[L][MoveFarLeft]

[L]
You[Beat] So you're the shrouded presence.[6N]
But how?[.6] How could you possibly[Beat] No![.6][N]
Affogato[,] you bear the Harbinger's power![AN]

[MR]
Right[,] Lord Gorlois.[.6] I hope this doesn't get[N]
in the way of our cooperation.[AN]
[CSS]

[FL][MoveLeft]

[FL]
[OpenQuote]Right"?[.6] This is another level of heresy[Beat][N]
The Harbinger is destined to bring forth an[N]
endless winter[,] much like now![AN]

[MR]
But that's incorrect[,] milord.[6N]
[Pause]Because of the twin deities.[AN][C]
The struggle between Ideon's lands have[N]
tipped the divine balance between the[N]
Great Flame and the Serpent.[AN]
The warmth of the Great Flame strays[,][N]
and the world strays colder[,] until[N]
the world becomes white.[6N]
The Harbinger only arrives in these[N]
times of ruin to bring balance back[N]
to these lands.[AN]

[FL]
That's[Beat] impossible[Beat][N]
All of this has been written record for eons[Beat][AN]

[MR]
It's the truth.[.6] I bear his mark.[AN]

[L]
I suppose it's not too far-fetched.[6N]
Something about the Harbinger's influence[N]
hid your steps[,] after all.[AN]

[MR]
The crows were unable to track me down[,][N]
milord.[.6] I'm not quite sure what this[N]
bodes exactly[,] but[Beat][AN]

[L]
How long were you watching us?[6N]
Did you plan that rescue in advance?[AN]

[MR]
I waited[,] but the Emperor spent too much[N]
time talking[,] so I released the arrow.[6N]
It's as simple as that.[AN][C]
I didn't want to reveal myself until[N]
I knew I wasn't in danger.[AN]

[L]
If I may say it plainly[,] Affogato[,][N]
you've seen the Empire's worst and[N]
have fought them alone.[AN]
But this war will take all of us.[6N]
A storm is coming[,] and none of us[N]
are fully prepared for it.[AN]
[CSS]
[FL][CF][Raial][MoveLeft]
Here's how it's gonna go down[,] cloak-boy.[6N]
We're gonna find where they're keeping[N]
Her Highness.[AN]
Then we're gonna break her out.[6N]
And then I'm going to find Selwyn[N]
and punch him in the face.[AN]
Maybe even twice.[.6] Or[Beat] three times.[6N]
And then I'm going to grab him by[N]
the horns and test out my new axe.[AN]

[MR]
Okay.[AN]

[FL]
Heh[,] you're the same as ever[,] huh?[6N]
Always unfazed by the world[Beat][AN]

[L][CF][Graham]
If you intend to stay[,] we must coordinate.[6N]
Our resources are limited[,] but not[N]
fully nonexistent.[AN]
[CSS]

[FL][CF][Gorlois]
I'll draw up a list of possible targets.[6N]
I will try to locate Princess Sylmeria[N]
and report back in time.[AN]
You should scout for a potential new[N]
base and for resources to last the war.[6N]
We don't have much time.[AN]
[CSS]

[L][CF][Ulrich]
Good.[.6] Then we're all aligned.[6N]
We must regroup and gather our strength.[6N]
And the next step is Vale.[AN]

[MR]
It's an honor.[AN]

[FL][Gorlois][L][Ulrich][R][Raial][FR][Graham]


[L]
So[Beat] This is Valeguard Keep in earnest.[6N]
We've settled a watch near the perimeters[,][N]
but the Consuls hold the next line north.[AN]
The Standing Points'll be where they're[N]
hiding.[.6] Consuls[,] altar[,] and the crown.[6N]
I'm sure of it.[AN]

[R]
We'll have to go there at some point[N]
and end this damn war.[.6] Where's[N]
the next stop?[AN]

[FL]
Reverend[,] you mentioned a potential forward[N]
base?[.6] Something smaller than Valeguard[,] yes?[AN]

[FR]
I scouted the old border maps from House[N]
Mariya's archives.[.6] An abandoned fortress sits[N]
just three leagues to the northeast.[AN]

[L]
We can't afford to go all the way to[N]
Cendshore now.[.6] Vetoed.[AN]

[FL]
Another castle is a few miles north.[6N]
However[,] it's held by Imperial troops.[AN]

[L]
The problem:[.4] we still lack manpower to[N]
hold two castles.[AN]

[FL]
Hmm[,] well[Beat] There's a bridge that ties the gap[N]
between outer Aeteria and the Argent Ridge.[6N]
If we cross that[,] we'll get to the Keep.[AN]

[R]
I got a damn good idea:[.4][N]
Strike at dawn[,] seize the gate[,] then[N]
breach towards the Standing Points.[AN]
That way[,] we'll just cross the bridge and[N]
blaze a trail towards the Keep.[.6][N]
Nothing else's necessary.[AN]

[L]
I suppose that'd work.[.6] We could then rest[N]
at the Keep[,] too.[AN]

[FFR][AffoSwitch]
Everyone.[AN][CSS]

[R][CF][FR][CF]

[FFR][AffoSwitch][MoveFarRight][.6][MoveMidRight]
My apologies for the delay.[6N]
I hope I didn't stall too long.[AN]

[L]
Affogato.[.6] Your report.[AN]

[MR]
Yes.[.6] There's a hidden pass to the north[,][N]
with a bridge spanning the river that leads[N]
directly to the Keep.[AN]
The Consuls' main patrols overlook the valley[,][N]
but not if we go through[Beat] Here.[6N]
If we cross at first light[,] we can seize the[N]
fortress before they reorganize.[.6] It's[N]
abandoned but fortified.[AN]

[L]
Then it's settled.[.6] At dawn[,] we march toward[N]
the bridge and take Valeguard Keep in[N]
one fell swoop.[AN][C]
Affogato[,] can you lead us directly there?[AN]

[MR]
Easily.[.6] Just follow my lead.[AN]
[CSS]

[FL][CF][Raial]
Finally[Beat] We can push into the true[N]
heart of Aeteria from there.[6N]
C'mon Selwyn[Beat] No more running![AN]

cause to believe in.[.6] Hell[,] the kingdom[N]
would've been bled dry![AN]

[FR]
You're the one who killed the Empress.[AN]

[ML]
Damn right.[.6] That's how the tale goes[,] right?[6N]
Odd way to thank me for it[,] kid.[AN]

[FR]
Not the tale.[.6] That's what you told[N]
us[,] Crownslayer.[AN]

[ML]
Yeah?[.6] She was right in her chambers.[6N]
I stuck past the palace security and[N]
all those fancy traps they had.[AN]

[FR]
It wasn't possible to bypass those traps[N]
unless you magically disabled them.[AN][CSS]

[ML][MoveML]
What[,] you an Imperial now?[AN][C]
Whatever way I got in,[.4] I got it done[,] man.[6N]
Throat open[,] cold floor[,] blah-blah[,] Zoria gone.[.6][N]
I mean[,] that's all that matters[,] right?[AN]

[CSS]
[FR][MoveMidRight]
[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Okay[,] you want the juicy details and the[N]
nitty-gritty[,] I get it.[.6] If I heard this story[,][N]
I wouldn't believe it either.[AN]
I crept in.[.6] We stared each other down like[N]
hounds[Beat] And then I ran in and slit her[N]
throat like it was nothing![AN]
I made her bleed slow[,] was a personal touch.[6N]
Just stood there and watched as the life[N]
crawled out of Her Excellency.[AN]
Watching the Imperial bleed and flail[Beat][N]
She clawed at the rug like a dying dog.[6N][Smile]
[Pause]She knew what was coming.[AN]
Is that good enough for you[,] kid?[6N]
You want more details[,] like the color[N]
of the room or the phase of the moon?[AN][Smile]

[MR]
Mm.[.6] That's wrong of you.[AN]

[ML]
Oh[,] boo-hoo.[.6] I'm sorry the Empress'[N]
assassination wasn't as moral of a tale[N]
as you hoped.[AN]

[MR]
No.[.6] This didn't happen.[AN]

[ML]
Oh yeah?[.6] Maybe I misremembered.[6N]
What do you know[,] kid?[AN]

[MR]
She wasn't cut in the throat.[6N]
They said that a dagger pierced her heart.[6N]
That's how she died.[AN]

[ML]
You read the reports or somethin'?[6N]
Y'know those were classified[Beat][N]
Don't worry[,] I won't tell nobody.[AN]

[MR]
Let me ask you:[.4] how did you get into[N]
the chambers after entering[N]
Castle Aeteria?[AN]

[ML]
Oh[,] it was pure charisma[,] I tell you.[6N]
[Pause]I just bribed the guards--[.4]those guys[,] ya[N]
know they're all about the gold.[AN]

[MR]
I know the chamber had two guards at[N]
the door.[.6] I hear they were found[N]
lying on the ground after the killing.[AN]

[ML]
Bullshit.[.6] You can't prove that.[.6] No one can.[.6][N]
She's dead[,] and that's what matters.[AN]

[MR]
She is.[.6] But you didn't kill her.[AN]

[ML]
Alright[,] fine[,] I get it.[.6] If you don't wanna[N]
believe me[,] there's nothing I can do to[N]
change your mind[,] kid.[AN]

[MR]
You know[,] the Imperial crown was having tons[N]
of trouble.[.6] And before I was a bluescarf[,][N]
I was a simple Velvet spy.[AN]
The crown had fractured--[.4]there was all this[N]
schism over the courts and disgruntled nobles[,][N]
all that loyalty nonsense.[AN][C]
There was a voice calling[Beat] And I found[N]
myself completing all sorts of jobs.[AN]

[ML]
Uh-huh.[.6] And?[.6] I'm on the edge of my[N]
seat over here.[AN]

[MR]
It was just another job.[.6][N]
Slip through the Standing Points[,] and evade[N]
the night rotation by a few minutes[Beat][AN]
Guards were watching a brazier at Greywatch.[6N]
Three flights up[,] second door on the left.[6N]
Two guards inside.[.6] No advisors that night.[AN]

[ML]
Yeah[,] okay.[.6] What's your point[,] kid?[AN]

[MR]
You see where this is going?[AN]

[ML]
Nah[,] you're just bragging about how good[N]
you are at breaking and entering.[AN]

[MR]
I saw a blurry shadow lying down on the bed[Beat][N]
and wedged the steel right in the heart.[6N]
Easy in.[.6] Easier out.[AN]

[ML][MoveML]
Hah![.6] So we're both sinners.[6N]
Good job[,] kid.[.6] After this war[,] you know what[N]
I think?[.6] We should team up[,] and--[AN]
[CSS]

[MR][MoveRight][Event]
Look[,] I'm in a hurry[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Huh?[AN]

[R]
Want to know what her name was?[AN]

[ML]
Her name[Beat]?[.6] Why the hell would I care?[6N]
I wouldn't know[,] anyways.[.6] Not like[N]
I keep track of every dead noble.[AN]

[R]
No[,] but you'd remember this one.[AN]

[ML]
What's with the attitude[,] kid?[.6][N]
I'm telling ya[,] I wouldn't know.[AN]

[R]
Then take a guess.[AN]

[ML]
Look[,] I--[AN]

[R]
[Pause]Listen to me[,] Weylan.[.6][AN][Event]
Her name was Empress Zoria IV of Aeteria[,][N]
and a black knife pierced her heart.[AN]
[CSS]

[ML][MoveFarLeft]
[Pause]I--[.4]I killed the Empress![.6] [MoveFL]It was me![.6][N]
You can't just--[AN]

[R]
Mm[,] sure you did.[6N]
I just did as I needed to.[AN][CSS][CF]

[Event]
[.6][.4]

[FFR]

[FL][MoveFarLeft]
What the hell[Beat]?[.6] Where are we?![6N]
What are you?![AN]

[MR][AffoShadowRealm][.6]

The[Beat] the black knife[Beat][AN][MoveFarLeft]
Y-[.4]You[Beat]![.6] You--[AN]
