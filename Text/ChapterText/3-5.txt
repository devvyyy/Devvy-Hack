[ML][Ulrich][FFR][LoadFace][0xB6][0x1][MoveFarRight]

[FR]
No one was watching the rear flank.[AN][CSS]

[ML][MoveLeft]
[L]
[Beat]The 7th Platoon's former scout.[AN]

[FR]
Sir.[AN]

[L]
So you return to us.[.6] I thought you were[Beat][N] 
I mean--[.4]I didn't think you were dead[,][N]
but I always hoped you would return.[AN][C]
I'm not sure what to say[,] except[Beat] thank you.[.6][N]  
You saved me again back there.[AN]

[FR]
You bade me farewell[,] Lieutenant.[AN]

[L]
Will you truly return to us?[6N]
After all this time and everything[N]
that's happened?[AN]

[FR]
I intend to.[.6] The Emperor must be stopped[N]
before Ideon ends.[AN]

[FL][Graham]
You have a strange sense of timing.[6N]
A few seconds later and we would be mourning[N]
Lieutenant Ulrich out there.[AN]
Your previous vanishing act aside[,][N]
you are clearly committed[Beat][N]
you must be the Ashen Rider.[AN][CSS]

[FL][Raial]
About time you showed up[,] cloak-boy.[6N]
You always just pop up after the dust settles[,][N]
don't you?[AN]

[FR]
Not always.[AN]

[L]
You returned despite your exile.[AN]

[FR]
Do you wish to cast me out again?[AN]

[L]
No[,] I believe we could work together.[6N]
We need to locate the Emperor[,] the[N]
Apostle[,] and any other key targets.[AN]
With your ability to always slip by[N]
unnoticed[,] you could prove to be a[N]
truly valuable soldier again.[AN]

[FL]
I wouldn't want to stand as your[N]
enemy[,] that's for sure.[AN]
[CSS]

[FR][MoveMidRight]
I'll fight with you for as long as[N]
this war rages.[.6] After that[,] we part ways..[AN]

[L][Smile]
I'm happy to have you with us[N]
again[,] Affogato.[AN]

[MR]
Likewise[,] Lieutenant.[AN][Smile][CSS]

[L][MoveFarLeft][L][CF][Gorlois]
You[Beat] You're the shrouded presence.[6N]
But how?[.6] How could you possibly[Beat][N]
No.[.6] Affogato[,] you bear the Harbinger's power![AN]

[MR]
Right[,] Lord Gorlois.[.6] I hope this doesn't get[N]
in the way of our cooperation.[AN]

[L][MoveLeft]
[OpenQuote]Right"?[.6] This is another level of heresy[Beat][N]
The Harbinger is destined to bring forth[N]
eternal winter![AN]

[MR]
But that's incorrect[,] milord.[AN][C]
[Pause]Because of the twin deities.[AN]
The struggle between Ideon's lands have[N]
tipped the divine balance between the[N]
Great Flame and the Serpent.[AN]
The warmth of the Great Flame strays[,][N]
and the world strays colder.[6N]
The Harbinger only arrives in these[N]
times of ruin to bring balance back[N]
to these lands.[AN]

[L]
That's[Beat] impossible[Beat][N]
It has been written record for eons[Beat][AN]

[MR]
It's the truth.[.6] I bear his mark.[AN]

[L]
I suppose it's not too far-fetched.[6N]
Something about the Harbinger's influence[N]
hid your steps[,] after all.[AN]

[MR]
Your crows were unable to track me down[,][N]
milord.[.6] I'm not quite sure what this[N]
bodes exactly[,] but[Beat][AN]

[FL]
How long were you watching us?[6N]
Did you plan that rescue in advance?[AN]

[MR]
I waited[,] but the Emperor spent too much[N]
time talking[,] so I released the arrow.[6N]
It's as simple as that.[AN][C]
I didn't want to reveal myself until[N]
I knew I wasn't in danger.[AN]

[FL]
If I may say it plainly[,] Affogato[,][N]
you've seen the Empire's worst and[N]
have fought them alone.[AN]
But this war will take all of us.[6N]
A storm is coming[,] and none of us[N]
are fully prepared for it.[AN]

[L][CF][Raial]
Here's how it's gonna go down[,] cloak-boy.[6N]
We're gonna find where they're keeping[N]
Her Highness.[AN]
Then we're gonna break her out.[6N]
And then I'm going to find Selwyn[N]
and punch him in the face.[AN]
Maybe even twice.[.6] Or[Beat] three times.[6N]
And then I'm going to grab him by[N]
the horns and test out my new axe.[AN]

[MR]
Okay.[AN]

[FL]
Heh[,] you're the same as ever[,] huh?[6N]
Always unfazed by the world[Beat][AN]

[L][CF][Graham]
If you intend to stay[,] we must coordinate.[6N]
Our resources are limited[,] but not[N]
fully nonexistent.[AN]

[FL][CF][Gorlois]
I'll draw up a list of possible targets.[6N]
I will try to locate Princess Sylmeria[N]
and report back in time.[AN]
You should scout for a potential new[N]
base and for resources to last the war.[6N]
We don't have much time.[AN]

[L][CF][Ulrich]
Good.[.6] Then we're all aligned.[AN]
We must regroup and gather our strength.[6N]
And the next step is Vale.[AN]

[MR]
It's an honor.[AN]

## Part3Chapter5Opening2
# affo is NOT real here

[ML]
So[Beat] This is Valeguard Keep in earnest.[AN]
We've settled a watch near the perimeters[,][N]
but the Consuls hold the next line north.[AN]
The Standing Points'll be where they're[N]
hiding.[.6] Consuls[,] altar[,] and the crown.[6N]
I'm sure of it.[AN]

We'll have to go there at some point[N]
and end this damn war.[.6] Where's[N]
the next stop?[AN]

[FL]
Gorlois[,] you mentioned a potential forward base?[6N]
Something smaller than Valeguard[,] yes?[AN]

I scouted the old border maps from House[N]
Mariya's archives.[.6] An abandoned fortress sits[N]
just three leagues to the northeast.[AN]

We can't afford to go all the way to[N]
Cendshore now.[.6] Vetoed.[AN]

Another castle is a few miles north.[6N]
However[,] it's held by Imperial troops.[AN]

[ML][Ulrich]
The problem:[.4] we still lack manpower to[N]
hold two castles.[AN]

Hmm[,] well[Beat] There's a bridge that ties the gap[N]
between outer Aeteria and the Argent Ridge.[6N]
If we cross that[,] we'll get to the Keep.[AN]

I got a damn good idea:[.4][N]
Strike at dawn[,] seize the gate[,] then[N]
breach towards the Standing Points.[AN]
That way[,] we'll just cross the bridge and[N]
blaze a trail towards the Keep.[.6][N]
Nothing else's necessary.[6N]

I suppose that'd work.[.6] We could then rest[N]
at the Keep[,] too.[AN]

[FFR][Affogato]
Everyone.[AN][CSS]

[FFR][MoveFarRight][.6][MoveRight]
My apologies for the delay.[6N]
I hope I didn't stall too long.[AN]

Affogato.[.6] Your report.[AN]

Yes.[.6] There's a hidden pass to the north[,][N]
with a bridge spanning the chasm that leads[N]
directly to Valeguard Keep.[AN]
The Consuls' main patrols overlook the valley[,][N]
but not if we go through[Beat] Here.[6N]
If we cross at first light[,] we can seize the[N]
fortress before they reorganize.[.6] It's[N]
abandoned but fortified.[AN]

Then it's settled.[.6] At dawn[,] we march toward the[N]
bridge and take Valeguard Keep in one[N]
fell swoop.[AN]

Finally[Beat] No more skirmishes![.6] We'll push[N]
into the true heart of Aeteria from there.[AN]
C'mon Selwyn[Beat] No more running![AN]

[X]

[3L]
Enough[,] brother.[AN]

[Pause]I see.[.6] So Syl was influenced by you.[AN]
You cannot resist meddling in affairs[N]
beyond your station.[AN]

I am the rightful heir to this throne.[6N]
Stand down or die[,] Selwyn.[AN]

Is that so[,] dear sister?[6N]
You[,] who knows nothing of statecraft and[N]
the empire[,] are the rightful heir?[AN]
You[,] who never met the Empress.[6N]
She was murdered by someone you[N]
stand side-by-side with[,] even now.[AN]

uhhh idk l ratio lmao
