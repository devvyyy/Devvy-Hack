[ML]
So this is Halds[,] en rout to Fort Loetoft.[.6][N]
I didn't realize such a peaceful town could[N]
exist nowadays.[AN]

[ML][MoveLeft]

[FL][Gerolf]
Peaceful?[.6] Looks like it's been abandoned for[N]
a while.[.6] Might've been useful[N]
seven months ago.[AN][CSS]

[FFR][Gorlois][MoveMidRight]

[FL][CF][Wegman][MoveLeft]
[L]
Well[,] look what the crow dragged in.[6N]
Thought we'd lost you for good, milord.[AN]

[MR]
Likewise[,] General Wegman.[.6] You're all late[N]
this time.[.6] We agreed on mid-morning.[.6][N]
And[Beat] You're not all royal blue.[AN][C]
Please explain.[AN]

[FL][CF][Raial]
Cool crow.[.6] Does he play nice?[AN]

[L][CF][Ulrich]
They're rebels from the empire[,] milord.[6N]
We've united forces under one banner.[6N]
We'll take Selwyn's head together.[AN]

[L][CF][Brudet]
Yes[,] these valiant souls rescued our own[N]
at the border keep.[.6] They've earned our[N]
trust for the time being.[AN]

[MR]
I see.[.6] So you've brought Imperials to my[N]
doorstep.[.6] The same ones who killed[N]
King Anatolius.[AN]

[FL][CF][Graham]
Imperials?[.6] The amount of Imperial lives we[N]
have taken[Beat] I am sure it exceeds your own.[6N]
I understand your position[,] milord.[AN]
His Majesty's death was unfortunate[,][N]
yes[,] but we were not the ones who[N]
sparked the flame.[AN]

[MR]
Your current Emperor's ambition lead to this.[6N]
I stood beside the King[Beat] I swore[N]
to guard his life.[AN]
The Emperor[,] the Apostle[,] and their[N]
Consuls rule all of Ideon's lands now.[6N]
You were just as guilty.[AN]

[L][CF][Raial]
Okay[,] so you failed.[.6] How the hell's that our fault?[AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[L]
The King was betrayed from within[,] right?[6N]
We had no hand in the dagger[,][N]
no matter what you think[,] milord.[AN]

[MR]
You expect me to just[Beat] break bread[N]
with the same colors who spelled doom[N]
for Wreyvine?[AN]
Do you expect me to simply smile at[N]
these[Beat] renegades?![.6] I should strike[N]
you down where you stand![AN]

[L]
You want to blame the Empire?[6N]
Fine[,] I don't give a damn about[N]
that part.[AN]
But know that we lost just as much[N]
when that throne turned red.[6N]
And we want Selwyn out.[AN]

[MR]
I will not hear this from an Imperial.[AN]

[L]
You have every right to hate us.[6N]
To doubt me[,] even.[.6] But don't doubt[N]
the people behind me.[AN]
We've burned our bridges and chose this.[6N]
Not because it's easy--[.4]but because the[N]
cost of doing nothing is worse![AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[L]
Wreyvine and Aeteria can walk the same road.[6N]
No[,] they must walk the same road if we[N]
want any chance to win this war.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[FL]
You know the Kingdom cannot win alone.[6N]
The Consuls tighten the noose with[N]
every breath we take.[AN]
Do you think your dwindling forces[N]
can carve through what's coming[N]
before you are all expunged?[AN]

[MR]
What then?[.6] If we trust you snakes[,][N]
how long will you march with us until[N]
the next twist of the knife?[AN]

[L][CF][Ulrich]
They stood and bled with us at the fortress.[6N]
They saved our captain's lives.[.6][N]
That's[Beat] no small thing.[AN]

[FL][CF][Brudet]
We owe them our thanks[,] I will not[N]
deny that[,] Lieutenant.[.6] But camaraderie[N]
is earned through fire and not favor.[AN]

[L][CF][Raial]
Then light the god-damned[,] stupid bloody fire.[6N]
We'll earn it.[.6] Just don't get in our[N]
way when we do.[AN]

[FL][CF][Ulrich]
[Pause]Milord.[.6] Please.[AN]

[MR]
Very well[.6] But understand that if I catch[N]
any sense of betrayal[,] my crows will[N]
gouge your eyes.[AN]
Come inside[,] then.[6N]
We've got a war to plan out, and I[N]
fear our time is quite limited.[AN]

[FL][CF][Graham]
Lord of Wreyvine[Beat] It was the only path[N]
forward. If you can trust us[,] we will show[N]
you unshakable loyalty.[AN]

[MR]
Follow me.[AN]

[L]
Come on[,] [OpenQuote]Lord of Wreyvine"?[6N]
I'm Raial[,] and this is Graham.[6N]
Who're you?[AN]

[MR]
Gorlois.[AN]

[FL]
You said you had updates.[.6] I suggest not[N]
wasting this hour on pleasantries.[AN]

[L]
Guess what[,] Malcolm?[.6] I don't care.[6N]
We're gonna be fighting with these guys[,][N]
so we might as well know them.[AN]

[MR]
I would love to chide you for not[N]
watching your tongue[,] but you are[Beat][N]
correct in your judgment.[AN]

[L]
What can I say?[.6] I'm usually right.[AN]

[MR]
I wasn't--[.4]nevermind.[AN][C]
We've confirmed an Imperial stronghold nearby.[N]
I hope you remember Castle Akrar?[6N]
That's your next destination.[AN]

[L][CF][Ulrich]
The castle south of here[,] right?[6N]
But that was manned by[Beat][AN]

[FL]
If we take it[,] it becomes more difficult for[N]
them to push back into the kingdom proper.[6N]
This will prove to be decisive.[AN]

[MR]
Lady Karina of the old Wreyvian guard[N]
leads the front.[.6] It seems she[6N]
traded her oaths for a title.[AN]

[FL][CF][Wegman]
[Beat]Impossible[Beat][N]
She helped write the old manuals.[6N]
Why would she be a turncoat?[AN]

[FL][CF][Klavdia]
Another filthy traitor[,] then.[6N]
Wegman?[.6] That crestfallen expression doesn't[N]
quite suit you.[AN]

[FL][CF][Wegman]
Ugh[,] I know.[.6] But[Beat][AN]

[MR]
More importantly[,] she's the one bottlenecking[N]
the last safe passage to the west.[6N]
Expect much resistance.[AN]

[L]
Are you going to stay here[,] milord?[AN]

[MR]
Of course.[.6] After all[,] I must prepare a[Beat][N]
housewarming party for our newfound[N]
Imperial guests.[AN]
I'll make sure this town remains secure.[6N]
You take her castle[,] and we'll split the[N]
Empire's presence across three fronts.[AN]

[FL][CF][Raial]
Hah![.6] We really got a fighting chance[Beat][AN]

[L][CF][Ulrich]
Get some rest.[.6] We march at first light.[AN]

[FL][Gerolf][L][Wegman][R][Graham][FR][Raial]

[FL]
This castle's larger than I remember.[6N]
I hope Lady Karina doesn't run from her[N]
grand estate before we get to her.[AN]

[L]
She's not gonna run.[.6] She was proud to[N]
a fault.[.6] She'll surround herself like a[N]
shell and let us break ourselves on the walls.[AN]

[FR]
How lovely.[.6] Another noble with a flair[N]
for the dramatic.[.6] Generals[,] you knew her[N]
prior to the old war[,] I presume.[AN][C]
Gimme the rundown.[AN]

[L]
I was under her tutelage for a time.[6N]
She sure loved her horses and platemail.[6N]
I'm betting that's what we'll face.[AN]

[FL]
She knows every hallway[,] every blind turn of[N]
this castle.[.6] Doubtless that we'll[N]
succumb massive casualties if we rush in.[AN]
But we need to take this fortress.[6N]
If Lady Karina has to die[,] so be it.[6N]
That's just the reality of war.[AN][CSS]

[R][CF][FR][CF]
[MR][Ulrich]
We need to proceed quickly.[6N][MoveMR]
Move![.6] You know the plan.[.6] Follow it and[N]
we end this today.[AN]

[MR]
They'll come soon[,] those maddening vultures[N]
with their patchwork banners.[.6] The[N]
state of Wreyvine is a sorry one[Beat][AN]

[L]
Shall I order the cavalry into position[,][N]
my lady?[AN]

[FL]
The scouts have spotted Imperial soldiers[N]
among their ranks.[.6] Those of the Noctum[N]
Order[Beat] and Captain Raial.[AN]

[MR]
The very directive that betrays His Excellency[N]
now comes to our doorstep.[.6] Let us[N]
swiftly dispatch of them.[AN]

[FL]
They have many leading the charge.[6N]
They'll try to attack us from every[N]
possible angle.[AN]

[MR]
Leave it to me and watch your six.[.6][N]
This old soul still has a hell of a[N]
fight left in her![AN]

This is another step towards victory.[6N]
We should not not linger.[.6] We have[N]
what we here came for.[AN]

[ML]
Was this really what we had to do[Beat]?[AN]

[MR]
The Consuls are not fools.[.6][N]
They knew this post mattered.[6N][CF]
[ML][CF]

[L][Ulrich][MR][Kelik]
[Beat]So it comes to this[Beat] You fools[Beat][N]
You defy Emperor Selwyn[Beat][N]
And for what?[.6] Pride?[AN]

[L]
Selwyn is a tyrant.[.6] Do you not see the[N]
citizens weep through scorched earth[N]
and tearing skies?[AN]

[MR]
And who are you?[.6] I bear no recollection[N]
of your face.[AN]

[L]
[Beat]I[Beat][AN][CSS]

[FL][Wegman]
Lady Karina[Beat] I never believed we'd find[N]
you like this.[.6] You stood taller than[N]
any of us![AN]

[MR]
Eli[,] your face hasn't changed at all.[6N]
Still so[Beat] mellow around the eyes.[6N]
I told you to always keep your head up.[AN][C]
Why didn't you?[AN]

[FL]
After the invasion[,] we thought you fell.[6N]
Like Ul[Beat] I[Beat] Lady Karina[,] why would[N]
you turn to THEIR side?![AN]

[MR]
You were always the loyal hound[,][N]
wagging your tail for the dead crown.[6N]
Don't succumb to your blindness.[AN][CSS]

[L][CF][Brudet]
You led drills with my father.[.6] He said[N]
you never bent a knee to those who[N]
do not deserve it.[AN]

[MR]
My vows as a knight meant nothing![6N]
I gave everything for the kingdom.[6n]
I believed in Wreyvine.[.6] In Anatolius.[AN]
The Crown is a lie![.6] They expect us to[N]
simply kneel when they order our sons[N]
into foreign lands?[AN][CSS]

[L][CF][Klavdia]
That war broke us all[,] milady.[6N]
But you don't have to be part of what[N]
breaks us now.[AN]

[MR]
And you[,] too[,] fight with the empire.[6N]
What will you do[,] chain me and make[N]
bow before your 'liberation'?[AN][CSS]

[L][CF][Ulrich]
Lady Karina[Beat] You still believe that[,][N]
even now?[.6] Even seeing up-close who stands[N]
beside us:[.4] old enemies[,] now allies?[AN][CSS]

[FL][CF][Graham]
We offer you a second path.[6N]
You knew the King and his values.[6N]
They should not die with you.[AN][CSS]

[L][CF][Raial]
Yeah[,] let's walk away from this.[6N]
Don't make us do what we came[N]
here to avoid.[AN][CSS]

[FL][CF][Ulrich]

[L][CF][Wegman]
I believe that everybody deserves a[N]
second chance.[.6] No matter what treachery[N]
or[Beat] enduring lies.[AN]

[MR]
Second chance?[.6] What a sanctimonious notion.[6N]
You think you can just hold out a hand[N]
and forget the graves I've dug?[AN]
You're all just carving out a new lie.[6N]
You'd be naive to think that replacing the[N]
crown will change what this land's become.[AN]

[FL]
You don't have to die here[,] milady.[6N]
We'll take you in.[.6] We'll vouch for you![AN]

[MR]
Do you think that means anything?[6N]
You want me to beg forgiveness?[6N]
You want me to[Beat] KNEEL?[AN][C]
I'll show you what I really think of[N]
your 'forgiveness.'[AN][MoveRight][Event]

[L]
Don't.[.6] Please.[.6] Don't make us--[AN]

[R]
I will fulfill my duty.[.6] Even if I'm[N]
the last knight of the old world.[6N]
The last to hold to my ideals.[AN]
You think you're liberators[Beat]?[6N]
I will strike down every one of you[N]
before I let your false dawn rise.[AN]
I will never surrender to a splintered[N]
banner stitched together by convenience[N]
and desperation![AN]

Stay down[,] Lady Karina[Beat][N][MoveFarLeft]
General[,] watch out![AN]
