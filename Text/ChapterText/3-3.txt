[ML]
So this is Halds[,] en rout to Fort Loetoft.[.6][N]
I didn't realize such a peaceful town could[N]
exist nowadays.[AN]
[CSS]

[ML][MoveLeft]

[FL][Gerolf]
Peaceful?[.6] Looks like it's been abandoned for[N]
a while.[.6] Might've been useful[N]
seven months ago.[AN][CSS]

[FFR][Gorlois][MoveMidRight]

[FL][CF][Wegman][MoveLeft]
[L]
Well[,] look what the crow dragged in.[6N]
Thought we'd lost you for good[,] milord.[AN]

[MR]
Likewise[,] General Wegman.[.6] You're all late[N]
this time.[.6] We agreed on mid-morning.[.6][N]
And[Beat] You're not all royal blue.[AN][C]
Please explain.[AN]
[CSS]

[FL][CF][Raial]
Cool crow.[.6] Does he play nice?[AN]

[CSS]
[L][CF][Ulrich]
They're rebels from the empire[,] milord.[6N]
We've united forces under one banner.[6N]
We'll take Selwyn's head together.[AN]

[CSS]
[L][CF][Brudet]
Yes[,] these valiant souls rescued our own[N]
at the border keep.[.6] They've earned our[N]
trust for the time being.[AN]

[MR]
I see.[.6] So you've brought Velvets to our[N]
doorstep.[.6] The same ones I imagine who[N]
led King Anatolius to his demise.[AN]

[CSS]
[FL][CF][Graham]
Velvets?[.6] The amount of Imperial lives we[N]
have taken[Beat] I am sure it exceeds your own.[6N]
I understand your position[,] milord.[AN]
His Majesty's death was unfortunate[,][N]
yes[,] but we were not the ones who[N]
sparked the flame.[AN]

[MR]
Your current Emperor's ambition lead to this.[6N]
I stood beside the King[Beat] I swore[N]
to guard his life.[AN]
The Emperor[,] the Apostle[,] and their[N]
Consuls rule all of Ideon's lands now.[6N]
You were just as guilty.[AN]

[CSS]
[L][CF][Raial]
Okay[,] so you failed.[.6] How the hell's that[N]
our fault?[AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[L]
The King was betrayed from within[,] right?[6N]
We had no hand in the dagger[,][N]
no matter what you think[,] milord.[AN]

[MR]
You expect me to just[Beat] break bread[N]
with the same colors who spelled doom[N]
for Wreyvine?[AN]
Do you expect me to simply smile at[N]
these[Beat] renegades?![.6] I should strike[N]
you down where you stand![AN]

[L]
You want to blame the Empire?[6N]
Fine[,] I don't give a damn about[N]
that part.[AN]
But know that we lost just as much[N]
when that throne turned red.[6N]
And we want Selwyn out.[AN]

[MR]
I will not hear this from a redslick[N]
prat on the wrong side of the bridge.[AN]

[L]
You have every right to hate us.[6N]
To doubt me[,] even.[.6] But don't doubt[N]
the people behind me.[AN]
We've burned our bridges and chose this.[6N]
Not because it's easy--[.4]but because the[N]
cost of doing nothing is worse![AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[L]
Wreyvine and Aeteria can walk the same road.[6N]
No[,] they must walk the same road if we[N]
want any chance to win this war.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[FL]
You know the Kingdom cannot win alone.[6N]
The Consuls tighten the noose with[N]
every breath we take.[AN]
Do you think your dwindling forces[N]
can carve through what's coming[N]
before you are all expunged?[AN]

[MR]
What then?[.6] If we trust you snakes[,][N]
how long will you march with us until[N]
the next twist of the knife?[AN]

[CSS]
[L][CF][Ulrich]
They stood and bled with us at the fortress.[6N]
They saved our captain's lives.[.6][N]
That's[Beat] no small thing.[AN]

[CSS]
[FL][CF][Brudet]
We owe them our thanks[,] I will not[N]
deny that[,] Lieutenant.[.6] But camaraderie[N]
is earned through fire and not favor.[AN]

[CSS]
[L][CF][Raial]
Then light the god-damned[,] stupid bloody fire.[6N]
We'll earn it.[.6] Just don't get in our[N]
way when we do.[AN]

[FL][CF][Ulrich]
[Pause]Milord.[.6] Please.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]Very well.[.6] But do understand that if I catch[N]
any sense of betrayal[,] my crows will[N]
gouge your eyes.[AN]
Come inside[,] then.[6N]
We've got a war to plan out[,] and I[N]
fear our time is quite limited.[AN]

[FL][CF][Graham]
Lord of Wreyvine[Beat] It was the only path[N]
forward.[.6] If you can trust us[,] we will show[N]
you unshakeable loyalty.[AN]

[MR]
Follow me and you'll get a chance to[N]
prove your [OQ]unshakeable loyalty".[AN]

[L]
Come on[,] [OpenQuote]Lord of Wreyvine"?[6N]
I'm Raial[,] and this is Graham.[6N]
Who're you?[AN]

[MR]
Gorlois.[AN]

[FL]
You said you had updates.[.6] I suggest not[N]
wasting this hour on pleasantries.[AN]

[L]
Guess what[,] Malcolm?[.6] I don't care.[6N]
We're gonna be fighting with these guys[,][N]
so we might as well know them.[AN]

[MR]
I would love to chide you for not[N]
watching your tongue[,] but you are[Beat][N]
correct in your judgment.[AN]

[L]
What can I say?[.6] I'm usually right.[AN]

[MR]
I wasn't--[.4]nevermind.[AN][C]
We've confirmed an Imperial stronghold nearby.[N]
I hope you remember Castle Akrar?[6N]
That's your next destination.[AN]

[CSS]
[L][CF][Ulrich]
The castle south of here[,] right?[6N]
But that was manned by[Beat][AN]

[FL]
If we take it[,] it becomes more difficult for[N]
them to push back into the kingdom proper.[6N]
This will prove to be decisive.[AN]

[MR]
Lady Karina of the old Wreyvian guard[N]
leads the front.[.6] It seems she[6N]
traded her oaths for a title.[AN]

[CSS]
[FL][CF][Wegman]
[Beat]But[Beat] Wh[Beat] Impossible[Beat][N]
She helped write the old manuals[,][N]
why would she be a turncoat?[AN]

[CSS]
[FL][CF][Klavdia]
Another filthy traitor[,] then.[6N]
Wegman?[.6] That crestfallen expression doesn't[N]
quite suit you.[AN]

[FL][CF][Wegman]
Ugh[,] I know.[.6] But[Beat][AN]

[MR]
More importantly[,] she's the one bottlenecking[N]
the last safe passage to the west.[6N]
Expect much resistance.[AN]

[L]
Are you going to stay here[,] milord?[AN]

[MR]
Of course.[.6] After all[,] I must prepare a[Beat][N]
housewarming party for our newfound[N]
Imperial guests.[AN]
I'll make sure this town remains secure.[6N]
You take her castle[,] and we'll split the[N]
Empire's presence across three fronts.[AN]

[CSS]
[FL][CF][Raial]
Hah![.6] We really got a fighting chance[Beat][AN]

[CSS]

Get some rest.[.6] We march at first light.[AN]

[FL][Gerolf][L][Wegman][R][Graham][FR][Raial]

[FL]
This castle's larger than I remember.[6N]
I hope Lady Karina doesn't run from her[N]
grand estate before we get to her.[AN]

[L]
She's not gonna run.[.6] She was proud to[N]
a fault.[.6] She'll surround herself like a[N]
shell and let us break ourselves on the walls.[AN]

[FR]
How lovely.[.6] Another noble with a flair[N]
for the dramatic.[.6] From what I gather[,] you[N]
Generals knew her prior to the old war?[AN][C]
Gimme the rundown.[AN]

[L]
I was under her tutelage for a time.[6N]
She sure loved her horses and platemail.[6N]
I'm betting that's what we'll face.[AN]

[FL]
She knows every hallway[,] every blind turn of[N]
this castle.[.6] Doubtless that we'll succumb[N]
massive casualties if we rush in.[AN]
But we need to take this fortress.[6N]
If Lady Karina has to die[,] so be it.[6N]
That's just the reality of war.[AN][CSS]

[R][CF][FR][CF]
[MR][Ulrich]
We need to proceed quickly.[6N][MoveMR]

state of Wreyvine is a sorry one[Beat][AN]

[L]
Shall I order the cavalry into position[,][N]
my lady?[AN]

[FL]
The scouts have spotted Imperial soldiers[N]
among their ranks.[.6] Those of the Noctum[N]
Order[Beat] and Captain Raial.[AN]

[MR]
The very directive that betrays His Excellency[N]
now comes to our doorstep.[.6] Let us[N]
swiftly dispatch of them.[AN]

[FL]
They have many leading the charge.[6N]
They'll try to attack us from every[N]
possible angle.[AN]
