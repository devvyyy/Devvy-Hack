[OpenMidRight]
This is the city's southern border.[N]
In a few miles farther west is Ideon's Bridge[,][N]
binding Wreyvine and Aeteria.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Their leader is residing in that fortress.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
So[,] they took over the border outpost?[6N]
[ToggleSmile]Sheesh[,] and these blokes didn't even[N]
pay their taxes![AN]
[ToggleSmile]Why don't we just charge in[N]
and take it back?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Listen to yourself.[.6] If we charge[N]
in[,] we are all going to die[Beat][AN]
[FL][ClearFace]

[OpenLeft]
Careful. They have many pegasi among their[N]
ranks.[.6] I'll handle them.[AN]

[FL][LoadUlrich]
Perhaps this is why the King wanted us to[N]
secure the old forts.[.6] But that's quite[N]
a large fortress.[AN]
If they took a hold of it[,] then[N]
their numbers must be[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidRight]
If they cross through here[,] the people of[N]
Wreyvine will be at risk.[.6] They cannot[N]
be allowed to pass through these holy gates.[AN]
Farewell for now.[.6] Focus on protecting the[N]
city border.[.6] I must take care of business[N]
elsewhere in the capital.[AN]
Send a messenger if you need anything.[6N]
Good luck out there.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
They're breaching our defenses[,] Father Floris![.6N]
I'm not really sure we can hold up[N]
any longer[ToggleMouthMove].[....].[....].[....][ToggleMouthMove][AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Keep your hat on;[.4] this is just the beginning[N]
of their siege![.6] Set up your turrets[,][....]
Yory.[.6] Reinforcements are coming.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
They never work[ToggleMouthMove].[....].[....].[....][ToggleMouthMove] I-[Beat]I'm starting
to lose faith.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Look at me when I talk to you[,] Yory.[6n]
You're not going to die here.[.6] The[n]
Hallowed One will see us through.[An]

[OpenMidRight]
I-[Beat]I'll try[,] I'll try.[AN][ClearFace]

[FFR][LoadBrudet][MoveMidRight]
Father Floris[,] I am here with the reinforcements[N]
that you requested.[.6] Are they enough?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Captain Brudet?[.6] Feh[,] took you long enough[ToggleMouthMove].[....].[....].[....][ToggleMouthMove][AN]
Eh[,] I wonder if these Aeterians have tried[N]
'talking it out'?[.6] Maybe send a messenger[N]
rather than such a large army[ToggleMouthMove].[....].[....].[....][ToggleMouthMove][AN]

[MR]
I must take my leave.[.6] I trust this army can[N]
drive the Aeterians out before twilight.[AN]
[Pause]Though I do wonder what an unarmed holy man
is doing on the front lines?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Oh![.6] You wound me[,] Captain.[.6] I still[N]
have my fighting spirit![AN]

[MR]
You use your staff as a walking cane[ToggleMouthMove].[....].[....].[....][ToggleMouthMove][N]
In all due respect[,] you really should not be[N]
out here[,] Father.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Nonetheless[,] Captain[,] I must fight until my last[N]
breath.[.6] It is the duty of a knight of Wreyvine[N]
to fight on the front lines[,] don't you agree?[AN]

[MR]
Indeed[,] yet[Beat] I truly cannot change[N]
your mind.[.6] Then it is settled.[AN]
We will regroup after matters are settled[N]
at the eastern passage.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Understood.[.6] We'll hold the eastern[N]
border[,] and protect Northelm![AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Lieutenant Hartmann[Beat] Hostiles engage from the
south.[.6] What are your orders?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Your orders were clear and have not changed:[AN]
Charge the city[Beat] Our aim here is to decimate[N]
their forces by splitting them amongst the[N]
capital and the palace.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Please[,] everyone[,] take notes.[.6]] [OpenEyes]They're
simple orders! The Duke must be weeping in[N]
his wake right now![AN]

[OpenLeft]
We will see to it[,] sir.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
One more thing.[.6] The men are split among the aerial[N]
soldiers[,] infantrymen[,] and the cavalry.[6N]
Only the infantry and cavalry must seize.[AN]
Aerial soldiers will arrive to assist you[,][N]
and they'll focus on direct combat![AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Understood[,] sir! We will begin[N]
the charge at once.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
We must succeed for the Duke.[.6] The Apostle.[6N]
The future of Aeteria[,] I swear on my heirs[Beat][N]
[CloseEyes]Wreyvine will remember this day.[AN]
[OpenEyes]They will regret the day they[N]
left us behind in the shadows[Beat][AN]

[R]
It's finally over[Beat] The Aeterians are[Beat][N]
retreating. It's like they were never[N]
here in the first place.[AN]

Ulrich
Are you alright[,] Affogato?[AN]

[R]
Everything is under control.[.6] But I do wonder[Beat][N]
Where could they be going?[.6] What are[N]
they planning?

(Wing SFX)

Stroganoff
Ah! A crow[Beat] You one of Gorlois' good friends?[6N]
Yeah[,] yeah.[.6] Looks like it.[.6] Oi[,] Rick.[6N]
This letter 'ere's for ya.[AN]

Ulrich
How did the crow know to track me down?[6N]
Let me read this[Beat]
[Beat]Ah[,] it's from[Beat] Gorlois?[AN]
I didn't know the King had a new advisor.[AN]

Stroganoff
Yeah[,] he's an odd fellow.[.6] Talks to his crow like[n]
he actually understands the bloody creature.[AN]

Ulrich
[Beat]This isn't good.[.6] The missive is asking us to[N]
head to the castle at once.[.6] It seems they find[N]
themselves in urgent circumstances.[AN]
Perhaps that's just the choppy penmanship[,] though.[AN]

[R]
[Beat]This attack must've been a ruse.[6N]
That explains why their soldiers were[N]
so weak[Beat][AN]
I believe the Duke's main forces are headed[N]
directly towards Castle Wreyvine now[,][N]
as we loiter.[AN]
Their charges must be focused towards[N]
the northern front.[AN]

Ulrich
The King's life is in danger if we linger.[6N]
The front of Northelm is the shortest[N]
route there.[AN]
We must bypass any side routes and head[N]
directly to Castle Wreyvine.[AN]

[ML]
We might have a problem.[.6] The Duke is surrounded[N]
by what looks like hundreds of soldiers[,][N]
and they're everywhere[,][AN]
blocking off the capital city.[.6] The main[N]
route is crawling with enemy soldiers.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat]Hundreds?![.6] There's absolutely no chance we[N]
can take all of those soldiers on. Not without[N]
regrouping with the King's men.[AN]

[ML]
We need to find an alternate route to Castle[N]
Wreyvine. Quickly.[.6] This place is too perilous--[.4][N]
it'd be unwise to risk it.[AN]
I know a route.[.6] There's a back passage[N]
towards the mountains.[AN]

[MR]
Affogato[,] tomorrow is going to be rough.[.6][N]
Your orders are to sneak behind enemy lines[,][N]
and send a messenger for Captain Brudet to[AN]
meet us at the back passage towards the[N]
mountains. It's the fastest indirect route[N]
to Castle Wreyvine.[AN]

[ML]
I'm counting on you.[.6] Meet you there.[AN]

This is a much larger crowd than I am used to[,] Sylvie. In truth[,] I am nervous.
Er[,] *ahem* Yes[Beat]
[Beat]Soldiers of the proud empire of Aeteria! The hour for redemption is upon us. I will hurt them as they hurt us. Today[,] the skies align in a perfect syzygy[,] fortelling our victory in yet another war. Let it be known that we shall claim Wreyvine[,] staining its soil with the blood of those responsible for the Empress--my mother's demise. Worry not[,] your homeland shall be shielded by the mighty branches of the Aeterian Trinity[,] bolstered by our Imperial Guard. It is true[,] my knights[,] that Aeteria has endured a grievous wrong. Yet it is now Aeteria's right to end it in triumph on their very own soil. Alas[,] Wreyvine[,] it is the continent of Ideon that will ring eternal in the writings of history. For the glory of Aeteria[,] and the future of Ideon!
