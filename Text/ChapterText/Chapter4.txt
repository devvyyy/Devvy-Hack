[OpenMidRight]This is the city border.[AN]
[OpenLeft]And it's just as cold as[N]
ever[Beat][AN]
I don't have a good feeling[N]
about this at all.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]So,[.4] they took over[N]
the border outpost?[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Sheesh,[.4] and they didn't[N]
even pay for the land![AN][ToggleSmile][0x80][0x23][0x86][0x82][0x80][0x80][.4]
[MoveFarLeft]What the-[.4][Event] Are those[Beat][N]
pegasi[Beat]?!
[OpenLeft]Perhaps this is why the King wanted[N]
us to secure the old forts.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]If they cross through here,[.4][N]
the civilians will be at risk.[AN]
Hurry,[.4] we have no time[N]
to waste![A][X]

## Ch4OpeningAlt1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffogato][OpenMidRight][LoadAtheya]
[OpenMidLeft]Is this the edge of[N]
the city?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[.6] This is the outpost[N]
that the Aeterians took over.[AN]
Their leader is most likely[N]
hiding there.[AN][0x80][0x23][0x86][0x82][0x80][0x80][.4]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]What the-[.4][Event] pegasi[Beat]?[.6][N]
You've got to be kidding.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Every second we waste,[.4][N]
civilians are at risk.[AN]
We can't let them[N]
through.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]Hey,[.4] Aeterians![AN]
Have you folk tried[N]
'talking it out'?[AN]
[CloseEyes]Maybe send a messenger instead[N]
of an army?[AN][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidRight][LoadAtheya]
[OpenMidRight]Father Floris,[.4] the rest of[N]

[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]Captain Brudet?[.6] Took you[N]

sir.[.6] Everything is fine.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The Aeterians are retreating.[.6][N]
I do wonder[Beat][AN]
Where could they be going,[.4][N]
what are they planning?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Athium is at no risk for[N]
now.[.6] [CloseEyes]We need to rest[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidRight]We have a long road[N]

[OpenFarFarLeft]Is everything alright?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadDoppio]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh![.6] This must be the crow of[N]
the King's new advisor.[AN]
[OpenLeft]The King's advisor[Beat][N]
owns a crow[Beat]?[AN]
And he delivers[Beat] letters?[.6][N]
Am I[Beat] dreaming?[AN]
The letter must be[N]
important,[.4] then.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]I've forwarded the letter,[.4][N]
Your Majesty.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]So our knights should arrive[N]
in around three days?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Give or take, correct.[.6][N]
So why did you summon them here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It's odd Aeteria hasn't attacked[N]
Wreyvine's royal palace yet.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]So you think they're planning[N]
an attack on a larger scale?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Indubitably.[.6] It's the only[N]
realistic possibility.[AN]
We must brace ourselves for an[N]
incoming strike at once.[A][N]
We'll need all of the soldiers[N]
nearby to be stationed here.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]They want Wreyvine's great heirloom[Beat][N]
Why don't we use the Eye of Creation?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Neither monarch can use[N]
their kingdom's great heirlooms.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]You're kidding?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][Beat][AN]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]Maybe I could try?[.6] It would[N]
certainly b-[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Don't think about it.[AN]
