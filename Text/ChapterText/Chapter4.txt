[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft]
Uhm.[.6] We had a minor scuffle at the capital[N]
with a few Imperial pillocks.[.6] We got the[N]

[OpenMidRight]
I am glad to hear it[,] truly.[.6] Here[,] we are[N]
at the city's southern border.[.6] In a few miles[N]

Hey[,] that's where the final battle took place.[6N]
I was just a wee lad out on the streets when[N]

Perhaps this is why the King wanted us to[N]

No[,] I don't think this force is as grand[N]

fighting larger forces.[AN]

If they cross through here[,] the people of[N]
Wreyvine will be at risk.[.6] Wreyvine's army[N]
is not grand enough to guard every site.[AN]
Farewell for now.[.6] Focus on protecting the[N]
city border.[.6] I must take care of business[N]
elsewhere in the capital.[AN]

You're doing that thing again with your[N]

[MR]
I don't know if I was ever meant for this[N]
war,[.4] Uncle.[.6] When Father passed,[.4] I[N]
thought the world would give me time.[AN]

[ML]
The world gave you nothing,[.6] and still[N]
you stood.[.6] I've seen soldiers twice[N]
your age collapse from less.[AN]

[MR]
Uncle[Beat] Do you remember when I was a child?[.6][N]
The wind was howling through the alleys[N]
of Soli[Beat][AN]
And I couldn't find my way home.[.6][N]
I screamed out [OQ]Mister Miksa!"[Beat] and[N]
you came running for me[Beat][AN]
You picked me up like I weighed nothing.[N]
I didn't understand why you cried[N]
then[,] but[Beat] I do now.[AN]

[ML]
You'd gotten lost chasing doves,[.4] if[N]
I recall.[.6] My ears were ringing from the[N]
cold[,] and then I heard your voice crack[AN]
through it all.[.6] Like the bells of[n]
the Flame.[AN]
I dropped the bundle of firewood right[N]
there and ran.[.6] I almost thought I'd[Beat][N]
lost you too.[AN]

[MR]
That night was the first time I thought the[N]
cold might kill me.[.6] And yet[Beat][N]
you arrived.[.6] You always did.[AN]
When Father died,[.4] it felt like no one[N]
would again or that no one could[Beat][N]
But you were there every time.[AN]

[ML]
And I'll keep being there as long as this[N]
withered body lets me.[.6] You were small,[.6][N]

This war[Beat] this war is unfair,[.4] Uncle.[.6][N]
It's burned holes into everything[N]

And everyone expects me to fill the one[N]
Father left behind.[.6] But I am not him.[6N]
He never saw what this war would ask of me.[N]

[ML]
You're not him[,] and thank the Flame for that.[AN]
You're Nora.[.6] The girl who finds her way[N]
through red snow just to save a stranger.[AN]
The healer who looks even death in the eye[N]
and says:[.4] [OQ]Not yet."[.6] The one[N]
with hope crossed in your heart.[AN]
I knew I wouldn't see the end of your[N]
story.[.6] And you[Beat] You still have time[N]
to choose.[AN]

[MR]
I just[Beat] I wish this war weren't ours to[N]
inherit.[.6] I wish I had more time to be[N]
a girl.[.6] With you and Father.[AN]
Uncle[Beat] I don't know how long any of[N]
this will last.[.6] But if you go before I[N]
can save you[Beat][AN]
If I never find a cure[,] then[Beat][N]
please know this:[.4] I wouldn't have made[N]
it this far without you.[AN]

[ML][Smile]
You've saved me tenfold already,[.6] Nora.[.6][N]
You've given this broken soul something[N]
to smile for.[AN]
Whether you call me Father,[.6] Uncle,[4N]
"Mister Miksa"[,] or even just some[N]
