[OpenMidRight]
This is the city’s southern border.[N]
In a few miles farther west is Ideon’s Bridge[,][N]
binding Wreyvine and Aeteria.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Their leader is residing in that fortress.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
So[,] they took over the border outpost?[6N]
[ToggleSmile]Sheesh[,] and these blokes didn't even[N]
pay their taxes![AN]
[ToggleSmile]Why don't we just charge in[N]
and take it back?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Listen to yourself.[.6] If we charge[N]
in[,] we are all going to die[Beat][AN]
[FL][ClearFace]

[OpenLeft]
Careful. They have many pegasi among their[N]
ranks.[.6] I'll handle them.[AN]

[FL][LoadUlrich]
Perhaps this is why the King wanted us to[N]
secure the old forts.[.6] But that’s quite[N]
a large fortress.[AN]
If they took a hold of it[,] then[N]
their numbers must be[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidRight]
If they cross through here[,] the people of[N]
Wreyvine will be at risk.[.6] They cannot[N]
be allowed to pass through these holy gates.[AN]
Farewell for now.[.6] Focus on protecting the[N]
city border.[.6] I must take care of business[N]
elsewhere in the capital.[AN]
Send a messenger if you need anything.[6N]
Good luck out there.[AN]

They're breaching our defenses[,][N]
Father Floris![A]
I'm not really sure we can
hold up any longer[ToggleMouthMove].[....].[....].[....][ToggleMouthMove][A]

Floris
Keep your hat on; this is just the beginning of their siege!
Set up your turrets[,][....]
Yory.[[Beat][Beat]] Aid must be coming.[A]
Yory
They never work[ToggleMouthMove].[....].[....].[....][ToggleMouthMove] I-[[Beat].]I'm starting
to lose faith.[A]

Floris
Look at me when I talk
to you[,][[Beat].] Yory.[A]
You're not going to die here.[[Beat][Beat]] The
Hallowed One will see us through.[A]

Yory
I-[[Beat].]I'll try[,][[Beat].] I'll try.[A]

Brudet
Father Floris[,][[Beat].] I am here with the reinforcements that you requested. Are they enough?

Floris
Captain Brudet?[[Beat][Beat]] Feh[,][[Beat].] took you
long enough[ToggleMouthMove].[....].[....].[....][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Eh[,] I wonder if these Aeterians have
tried 'talking it out'?[A]
Maybe send a messenger rather
than such a large army[ToggleMouthMove].[....].[....].[....][ToggleMouthMove][A]

Brudet
I must take my leave.[[Beat][Beat]] I trust this army
can drive them out before twilight.[A]
Though I do wonder what an unarmed holy man
is doing on the front lines?[A]

Floris
Oh! You wound me[,][[Beat].] Captain.[[Beat][Beat]] I still
have my fighting spirit![A]

Brudet
You use your staff as a
walking cane[ToggleMouthMove].[....].[....].[....][ToggleMouthMove][A]
In all due respect[,] you really should not be
out here[,][[Beat].] Father.[A]

Floris
Nonetheless[,] Captain[,][[Beat].] I must fight until
my last breath.[A]
It is the duty of a knight of Wreyvine to fight on the front lines[,] don’t you agree?

Brudet
Indeed[,] yet[Beat] I really cannot change
your mind.[[Beat][Beat]] Then it is settled.[A]
We will regroup after matters are settled
at the Eastern passage.[A]

Floris
Understood.[[Beat][Beat]] We’ll hold the eastern
border[,][[Beat].] and protect Northelm![A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Lieutenant Hartmann[Beat] Hostiles engage from the
south.[.6] What are your orders?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Your orders were clear and have not changed:[AN]
Charge the city[Beat] Our aim here is to decimate[N]
their forces by splitting them amongst the[N]
capital and the palace.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Please[,] everyone[,] take notes.[.6]] [OpenEyes]They're
simple orders! The Duke must be weeping in[N]
his wake right now![AN]

[OpenLeft]
We will see to it[,] sir.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
One more thing.[.6] The men are split among the aerial[N]
soldiers[,] infantrymen[,] and the cavalry.[6N]
Only the infantry and cavalry must seize.[AN]
Aerial soldiers will arrive to assist you[,][N]
and they’ll focus on direct combat![AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Understood[,] sir! We will begin[N]
the charge at once.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
We must succeed for the Duke.[.6] The Apostle.[6N]
The future of Aeteria[,] I swear on my heirs[Beat][N]
[CloseEyes]Wreyvine will remember this day.[AN]
[OpenEyes]They will regret the day they[N]
left us behind in the shadows[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffogato]

Affogato
It’s finally over[Beat] The Aeterians are[Beat][N]
retreating. It’s like they were never[N]
here in the first place.[AN]

Ulrich
Are you alright[,] Affogato?[AN]

Affogato
Everything is under control.[.6] But I do wonder[Beat][N]
Where could they be going?[.6] What are[N]
they planning?

(Wing SFX)

Stroganoff
Ah! A crow[Beat] You one of Gorlois’ good friends?[6N]
Yeah[,] yeah.[.6] Looks like it.[.6] Oi[,] Rick.[6N]
This letter ‘ere’s for ya.[AN]

Ulrich
How did the crow know to track me down?[6N]
Let me read this[Beat]
[Beat]Ah[,] it’s from[Beat] Gorlois?[AN]
I didn’t know the King had a new advisor.[AN]

Stroganoff
Yeah[,] he’s an odd fellow.[.6] Talks to his crow like[n]
he actually understands the bloody creature.[AN]

Ulrich
[Beat]This isn’t good.[.6] The missive is asking us to[N]
head to the castle at once.[.6] It seems they find[N]
themselves in urgent circumstances.[AN]
Perhaps that’s just the choppy penmanship[,] though.[AN]

Affogato
[Beat]This attack must’ve been a ruse. That explains why their soldiers were so weak[Beat] I believe the Duke’s main forces are headed directly towards Castle Wreyvine now[,] as we loiter. Their charges must be focused towards the northern front.

Ulrich
The King’s life is in danger if we linger. The front of Northelm is the shortest route there. We must bypass any side routes and head directly to Castle Wreyvine.

[OpenMidLeft]I've forwarded the letter,[.4][N]
Your Majesty.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]So our knights should arrive[N]
in around three days?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Give or take, correct.[.6][N]
So why did you summon them here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It's odd Aeteria hasn't attacked[N]
Wreyvine's royal palace yet.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]So you think they're planning[N]
an attack on a larger scale?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Indubitably.[.6] It's the only[N]
realistic possibility.[AN]
We must brace ourselves for an[N]
incoming strike at once.[A][N]
We'll need all of the soldiers[N]
nearby to be stationed here.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]They want Wreyvine's great heirloom[Beat] Why[N]
don't we use the Eye of Creation?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Neither monarch can use their[N]
kingdom's great heirlooms.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]You're kidding?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]Maybe I could try?[.6] It would[N]
