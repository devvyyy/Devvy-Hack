[OpenMidRight]This is the city border.[AN]
[OpenLeft]And it's just as cold as[N]
ever[Beat][AN]
I don't have a good feeling[N]
about this at all.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]So,[.4] they made use of our[N]
abandoned fortress.[AN][0x80][0x23][0x86][0x82][0x80][0x80][.4]

[OpenLeft][Pause]Those pegasus riders from[N]

It wasn't that they didn't[N]
notice us,[AN]
they were headed for[N]
the capital borders.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]So we aren't the only ones[N]
who just arrived[.4] eh?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]If they cross through here,[.4][N]
the civilians will be at risk.[AN]
Hurry,[.4] we have no time[N]
to waste![A][X]

## Ch4OpeningAlt1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffogato][OpenMidRight][LoadAtheya]
[OpenMidLeft]Is this the edge of[N]
the city?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[.6] An abandoned fort[N]
lies here.[AN]
Their leader is most likely[N]
hiding there.[AN][0x80][0x23][0x86][0x82][0x80][0x80][.4]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]What the-[.4][Event] Are those[Beat][N]

[OpenLeft][Pause]Those pegasus riders from[N]
earlier[Beat][AN]
It wasn't that they didn't[N]
notice us,[AN]
they were headed for[N]

[OpenMidRight]Every second we waste,[.4][N]
civilians are at risk.[AN]
We can't let them[N]

There's pegasi everywhere,[.4][N]

But this is the edge of the[N]
city![AN]
Where could they be going,[.4][N]
what are they planning?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidRight]We don't have the men[N]
to give chase.[AN]
Let them retreat for[N]
now.[AN]
We have a long road[N]
ahead.[AN]
We'll set up camp and[N]
prepare for tomorrow.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Got it,[.4] sir.[.6] I'll[N]

## Ch4Ending3
[OpenFarLeft][LoadAffogato][OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft]
[OpenLeft]It's[Pause] [.4]a crow?[.6][AN]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadBirb][MoveRight]
[OpenFarFarLeft]Is everything alright?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadDoppio]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh![.6] This must be the crow of[N]
the King's new advisor.[AN]
[OpenLeft]The King's new advisor[Beat][N]
has a crow[Beat]?[AN]
The letter must be[N]
important,[.4] then.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]It looks like it's directed[N]

## Ch4Ending4
[OpenLeft][LoadEis][OpenRight][LoadFloris][OpenFarRight][LoadBreve]
[OpenLeft]And you're sure they're[N]
the same Keepers?[AN]
[OpenRight]Absolutely.[AN]
They were members of an order[N]
that aim to appease the Hallowed[AN]
King by putting Wreyvine in[N]
an endless stasis.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]They were wiped out alongside[N]
their leader years ago[Beat][AN]
What could be the cause of[N]
this resurgence?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadUlrich]
[OpenFarLeft]Hate to interrupt and all,[.4] but[N]
the King summons us to[AN]
the palace.[.6] The letter didn't[N]
seem urgent,[.4] but we should[N]
march tomorrow nonetheless.[AN]
We should be able to make it[N]
there in three days or so.[A][X]

## Ch4EndingAlt4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier2]
[OpenMidLeft]We march tomorrow at noon.[.6] The[N]
King summons us to the palace.[AN]
The letter didn't seem very[N]
urgent.[.6] I'm not concerned.[AN]
I'm sure we'll arrive within[N]
three days or so.[A]
[OpenMidRight]The Keepers should be[N]
driven back for now.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Keepers?[.6] You don't[N]
mean-[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It is indeed the same[N]
Keepers,[.4] sir.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]The same order that[N]
aimed to put Wreyvine into stasis?[AN]
To appease the Hallowed King?[.6][N]
They disappeared years ago[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidRight]The one and only.[.6] I don't know[N]
what caused their resurgence,[AN]
but I'm not looking forward[N]
to finding out.[A][X]
