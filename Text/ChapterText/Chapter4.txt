You are behind time.[.6] I presume there was a[N]
battle at the capital.[.6] Was anybody injured?[AN]

[L]
[Beat]There w--[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

[OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft]
Uhm.[.6] We had a minor scuffle at the capital[N]
with a few imperial pillocks.[.6] We got the[N]
civilians out safe[,] though.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I am glad to hear it[,] truly.[.6] Here[,] we are[N]
at the city's southern border.[.6] In a few miles[N]
farther west is Ideon's Bridge,[AN]
binding Wreyvine and Aeteria.[AN]

[L]
Hey[,] that's where the final battle took place.[6N]
I was just a wee lad out on the streets when[N]
I heard Wreyvine got its rear handed to--[AN]

[FL]
Right.[.6] Affogato[,] do you notice anything?[AN]

[OpenLeft][ClearFace][LoadAffogato]
Their leader is residing in that fortress[,][N]
I'm sure of it.[AN][Clear]
[Mouth](If we can take our their leader[,] then with[N]
their numbers[,] they'll be put in a position[N]
where they're forced to retreat.)[AN][Mouth]

[FL][ClearFace][LoadStroganoff][OpenFarLeft]
So[,] they took over the border outpost?[6N]
[ToggleSmile]Sheesh[,] and these blokes didn't even[N]
pay their damned taxes![AN]
[ToggleSmile]How about we just charge in and[N]
take it all back?![.6] Bash their doors[N]

[OpenMidRight]
These are our doors[Beat] Wreyvine's doors[Beat][N]
And if we charge in like that[,] we are all[N]
going to die[Beat][AN]
[FL][ClearFace]

[FL][LoadUlrich]
Perhaps this is why the King wanted us to[N]
secure the old forts.[.6] But that's quite[N]
a large fortress to be left unused.[AN][Clear]
If they took a hold of it[,] then I imagine[N]
their numbers must be[Beat][AN]

[OpenLeft]
No[,] I don't think this force is as grand[N]
as we think it is.[.6] The sky is dark[N]
and covered in fog.[AN]
They can easily obfuscate their true[N]
numbers to lead us to believe we're[N]
fighting larger forces.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
If they cross through here[,] the people of[N]
Wreyvine will be at risk.[.6] Wreyvine's army[N]
is not grand enough to guard every site.[AN]
Farewell for now.[.6] Focus on protecting the[N]
city border.[.6] I must take care of business[N]
elsewhere in the capital.[AN]
I leave it to you to cover the area.[6N]
They must not pass through these gates.[6N]
Send a messenger if you need assistance.[AN][Clear]

Are you as troubled as I am?[AN]

[MR]
No[,] I'm confident they don't have[N]
the numbers to get through the border[N]
and do any more harm.[AN][Clear]
There's only a few dozen[,] and they're[N]
hardly near the gates.[.6] They must[N]
all be between the mountains.[AN]

[ML]
So where are the rest of their forces?[AN]

[MR]
I'm not sure[,] but I have a few ideas in mind.[AN]
Either way[,] if we can take our their leader[,][N]
then they'll be forced to retreat.[AN]
