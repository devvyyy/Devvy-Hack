Northelm Border[X]

## Ch4Opening1
# [Event] does not work with sound effects playing??
[OpenFarLeft][LoadStroganoff][OpenLeft][LoadAffogato][OpenMidRight][LoadAtheya]
[OpenMidRight]This is the city border.[AN]
[OpenLeft]And it's just as cold as[N]
ever[Beat][AN]
I don't have a good feeling[N]
about this at all.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]So,[.4] they took over[N]
the border outpost?[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Sheesh,[.4] and these fellas didn't even[N]
pay their taxes![AN][ToggleSmile]
Why don't we just charge[N]
in and take it back?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Listen to yourself.[.6] If we charge[N]
in,[.4] we're all going to die[Beat][AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][.4]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]What the-[.4][Event] Are those[Beat][N]
pegasi[Beat]?![AN]
[OpenLeft]Perhaps this is why the King wanted[N]
us to secure the old forts[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidRight]If they cross through here,[.4][N]
the civilians will be at risk.[AN]
Farewell for now.[.6] Focus on[N]
protecting the city border.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffogato][OpenMidRight][LoadAtheya]
[OpenMidLeft]Is this the edge of[N]
the city?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes.[.6] This is the outpost[N]
that the Aeterians took over.[AN]
Their leader is most likely[N]
hiding there.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][.4]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]What the-[.4][Event] pegasi[Beat]?[.6][N]
You've got to be kidding.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Every second we waste,[.4][N]
civilians are at risk.[AN]
They cannot be allowed[N]
to pass.[AN]
I've been tasked with another mission.[.6][N]
Farewell for now.[AN]
Rally the others and[N]
drive them off![A][X]

[OpenMidRight]They're breaching our defenses,[N]
Father Floris[Beat][AN]
I'm not really sure we can[N]
hold up any longer[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Set up your turrets,[.4][N]
Yory.[.6] Aid must be coming.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
They never work[Beat] I-[.4]I'm starting[N]
to lose faith.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Look at me when I talk[N]
to you,[.4] Yory.[AN]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadYory][MoveMidRight][.6]
[OpenMidLeft]
You're not going to die here.[.6] The[N]
Hallowed One will see us through.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I-[.4]I'll try,[.4] I'll try.[AN][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadAtheya]
[OpenMidRight]Father Floris,[.4] the rest of[N]
the knights are here.[AN]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]Captain Brudet?[.6] Feh,[.4] took you[N]
long enough[Beat][AN]
I wonder if these Aeterians have[N]
tried 'talking it out'?[AN]
Maybe send a messenger rather[N]
than such a large army[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidRight]I must take my leave.[.6] I trust you[N]
can drive them out before twilight.[AN]
Though I do wonder what a healer[N]
is doing on the front lines?[AN]

[OpenLeft]
You wound me,[.4] Captain.[.6] I still[N]
have my fighting spirit![AN]

[OpenMidRight]
You're using your staff as a[N]
walking cane[Beat][AN]
You really should not be[N]
out here,[.4] Father.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
Brudet,[.4] I will fight until[N]
my last breath.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Ergh,[.4] I really can't change[N]
your mind.[.6] Then it's settled.[AN]
We'll regroup after matters are settled[N]
at the Eastern passage.[AN]
[OpenLeft]Understood.[.6] We will hold the[N]
border,[.4] and protect Northelm![A][X]

## Ch4Opening3
[OpenFarLeft][LoadShaman][OpenLeft][LoadBanditBoss][OpenMidRight][LoadHartmann]
[OpenFarLeft]Sir[Beat] Hostiles engage from the[N]
south.[.6] Orders?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Your orders were clear and[N]
have not changed:[.4] charge the city[Beat][AN]
Our aim here is to decimate[N]
their forces by splitting[AN]
them amongst the capital[N]
and the palace.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Please,[.4] everyone, take notes.[.6] [OpenEyes]They're[N]
simple orders![AN]

[OpenLeft]
Ah,[.4] right.[.6] There's a lot of soldiers[N]
stationed here.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Far more than the ones attacking the[N]
Pale Palace,[.4] though?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
That's where Eustace's genius[N]
comes in.[AN]
Experimental soldiers,[.4] morphed through[N]
the Ashen Rider[Beat][AN]
They're going to target the Pale[N]
Palace with them.[AN]
Our numbers here will be far greater[N]
than theirs.[AN]
Our numbers there will also be far greater[N]
than theirs.[AN]
We must attack here as a diversion[N]
for the heist at the palace.[AN] 

[OpenFarLeft]
We will see to it.[AN][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]Wreyvine will remember this[N]
day.[AN]

[OpenEyes]They will regret the day they[N]
left us behind in the shadows[Beat][A][X]

It's finally over[Beat][.6] Huff[Beat][.6] The[N]

[OpenMidLeft]No.[.6] [OpenEyes]Er,[.4] I mean,[.4] yes,[.4][N]
sir.[.6] Everything is fine.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The Aeterians are retreating.[.6][N]
I do wonder[Beat][AN]
Where could they be going,[.4][N]
what are they planning?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Northelm is at no risk for[N]
now.[.6] [CloseEyes]We need to rest[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidRight]We have a long road[N]

We'll set up camp and[N]

[OpenFarFarLeft]Is everything alright?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadDoppio]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh![.6] This must be the crow of[N]
the King's new advisor.[AN]
[OpenLeft]The King's advisor[Beat][N]
owns a crow[Beat]?[AN]
And he delivers[Beat] letters?[.6][N]
Am I[Beat] dreaming?[AN]
The letter must be[N]
important,[.4] then.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]It looks like it's directed[N]

## Ch4Ending4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGorlois][OpenMidRight][LoadKing]
[OpenMidLeft]I've forwarded the letter,[.4][N]
Your Majesty.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]So our knights should arrive[N]
in around three days?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Give or take, correct.[.6][N]
So why did you summon them here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It's odd Aeteria hasn't attacked[N]
Wreyvine's royal palace yet.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]So you think they're planning[N]
an attack on a larger scale?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Indubitably.[.6] It's the only[N]
realistic possibility.[AN]
We must brace ourselves for an[N]
incoming strike at once.[A][N]
We'll need all of the soldiers[N]
nearby to be stationed here.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]They want Wreyvine's great heirloom[Beat] Why[N]
don't we use the Eye of Creation?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Neither monarch can use their[N]
kingdom's great heirlooms.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]You're kidding?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][Beat][AN]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]Maybe I could try?[.6] It would[N]
certainly b-[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Don't think about it.[AN]
