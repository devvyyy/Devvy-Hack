[OpenLeft]
So you two are Aeterian,[.4][N]
correct?[.6][AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Now that the battle's over,[N]
I have a few questions.[AN]
Why in the Hallowed One's name[N]
is Aeteria invading Wreyvine?[AN]

[OpenRight]
We've left Aeteria for many[N]
moons now.[AN]
We only have guesses and rumors[N]
from aboard the ship.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
From what I heard,[.4] Her Majesty has been[N]
obsessing over some[Beat] prophecy lately.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]Sounds like the Queen,[.4][N]
all right.[AN]

[OpenRight]
The Aeterian Trinity's all over[N]
it,[.4] too.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
Mm.[.6] Said your 'glorious' Hallowed One[N]
is returning to Ideon.[AN]
Kept spewing some hogwash about[N]
"getting left in the dark".[AN]
Now,[.4] I'm as devout as the[N]
other Aeterians-[AN]
not like you Wreyvians know much[N]
about our faith in the moon-[AN]
but she's never been this[N]
serious before.[AN]

[OpenRight]
She said the forces won't stop 'til[N]
they obtain the Eye.[AN]
It's only a matter of time before[N]
Aeteria targets the Wreyvian capital,[AN]
or,[.4] with enough forces,[.4] maybe[N]
even your king's Pale Palace.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]We can't let that happen,[.4][N]
no matter the cost.[AN]
If you two don't have anywhere[N]
to go,[AN]
then why don't you stay with[N]
us for the time being?[AN]
We could use any blade arm[N]
we can get.[AN]

[OpenRight]
We'd be honored,[.4][N]
sir.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]Point me at the enemy[N]
and watch me work.[AN][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace]

[OpenLeft][MoveMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadAffo][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]

[Event]

[OpenMidRight]
Okay,[.4] I heard their stories[N]
and all,[.4] sir.[AN]
Can we really trust these[N]
two Aeterians,[.4] though?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
I understand your concern,[.4] Affogato-[.4][N]
I have my doubts as well.[AN]
But we have no other voice to[N]
believe right now.[AN]
And everything matches up[N]
with[Beat] forget it.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
If what they're saying is true,[.4][N]
then the Eye of Creation is at risk.[AN]
Where is it located? Is it[N]
in any risk?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
It's safeguarded by the holy guard[N]
in Wreyvine's Pale Palace.[AN]
The holy guard is Wreyvine's[N]
last line of defense.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Wow,[.4] that's bad. Let's just hope[N]
it never comes to that[Beat][AN][X]
