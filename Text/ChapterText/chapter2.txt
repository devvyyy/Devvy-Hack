Brr[Beat] Is it always this chilly 'round this[N]
time of year?[.6] First General Messel hires us[N]
for a measly 1200 gold[,][AN]
then he deploys us an ocean away![AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I'm sure that his decision was not personal[,] Rina.[6N]
I think you should be more concerned about[N]
how half of the mercs deserted[,][AN]
including our captain[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Oh[,] right[Beat] Those blithering cowards![.6N]
If they ever showed their cursed faces[N]
back here[,] I'd cut each and every[N]
one of them down![AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Relax.[.6] I need to take another nap[Beat][N]
I don't think we're built for the North[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Pandoro[,] you don't understand.[.6] We need[N]
to prove ourselves![.6] Blade and axe![.6] Cleave[N]
ourselves out of this tomfoolery that[AN]
the Ashen Rider has placed upon us![AN]

[OpenMidRight]

Oh[,] by the Hallowed One[,][AN]
there's Aeterian soldiers here[,] too![AN]

Of course there are.[.6] With how quickly this[N]

So[,] while we're on the way to the capital[,][N]
tell us what you know about the[N]
ongoing invasion.[AN]

[R]
We're just a buncha mercs[Beat] But from[N]
what I've heard[,] the Duke intends on[N]
razing Wreyvine to the ground--[AN]
And I think he means it literally[,] too![AN]

[FR]
Well[,] he believes Wreyvine is responsible.[6n]
Nobody does that out of imperial duty.[6n]
I just fight and I get paid.[an]

[R]
For real![AN]

[FL]
Wreyvine has always had 'iffy' relations with[n]
Aeteria[,] to say the least.[.6] I remember[N]
times from a bygone age where it was[N]
at least[Beat] amicable.[.6] It wasn't until the[N]
Empress' Holy War Twenty-four years ago that[N]
everything changed.[AN]

[R]
So[Beat] What's our next job?[AN]

[FL]
We need to rescue Wreyvian soldiers in the[N]
capital city.[.6] You two[,] show us[N]
that your blades are worth the gold.[AN]

[FR]
Alright[,] boss.[.6] We'll do what we can.[AN]

[R]
Now's our chance to prove ourselves[,] Pandy![AN]

Ah[,] Sir Ulrich![.6] Everyone![.6][N]
Messenger![.6] Messenger![.6] I'm delivering[N]
a message to all roaming platoons.[AN]

[ML]
Mocha.[.6] Your station was in the capital city.[6n]
Something dire must've happened for[n]
a messenger to be here.[an]

[R]
Sir[,] I bring word from Northelm:[.6][0x80][0x2C][0xA][N]
"There's a horde of Aeterians at the capital[N]
city![.6] They'll be upon us soon!"[AN][0x80][0x2C][0xD]
We're in a race for time.[.6] The duke and[N]
the apostle themselves have passed through[N]
Northelm![.6] If we don't hurry to the capital[,][AN]
I don't think Captain Stroganoff and his men[n]
can hold for much longer![.6] Reinforcements[n]
are absolutely crucial here.[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]That's a surprisingly accurate impression.[6n]
Alright[,] let's move.[.6] If the Aeterian duke[n]
himself is there[,][AN]
then we really have no time to waste[,][N]
lest Northelm falls.[.6] Come now[,][N]
