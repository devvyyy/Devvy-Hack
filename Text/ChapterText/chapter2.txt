Your Majesty[,] I've never known any purpose[N]

The Aeterian army carved me a path.[AN]
I come from a desolate frontier town[,] born[N]

[FFR]
You need to integrate with the Wreyvian army.[6N]

Wreyvian hunter who wants to fight with[N]

[Pause]Yes[,] officer[Beat] I've mapped out the[N]

Look here[,] here[,] and[Beat] here.[AN]
Wreyvine is home to treacherous mountains[,][N]
and unmelting ice and snow.[.6] These are the[N]
only viable roads between these castles.[AN]
I imagine in the time to come that[N]
excavations will open up new paths[,][N]
but for now it'll suffice.[AN]
If you can draw out their forces from within[N]
these castles[,] they have only one road[N]
to take.[.6] It'll be a quick sweep.[AN]
Kingdom soldiers circle the snow-filled[N]
terrain on horseback.[.6] Fliers monitor[N]
uneasy terrain in even intervals.[AN]
The guards stationed at outposts clock in[N]
and rotate in the morning[,] before[N]
every first light.[AN]
Assuming fair weather in the kingdom[,][N]
soldiers are posted at each of the capital[N]
city's four border checkpoints.[AN]
I'm sure that with a bit of luck and sound[N]
timing[,] and perhaps a[Beat] fiery distraction[Beat]][N]
Victory is as good as ours.[AN]

[FFR]
Incredible[,] Apsiel[Beat] Such detailed notes.[6N]
We'll be sure to use your observations[N]
for years to come.[AN]

[L]
Of course[,] officer.[.6] It has been nothing[N]
short of an honor to fight for the empire.[AN]

Then that is all for now[,] my friend.[6N]

Where does your[Beat] idealism come from?[6N]

Only Gramps was in the royal guard.[.6][N]

Gramps doesn't like talking about it.[.6][N]

We've been doing fine so far[,] what makes[N]

[OpenMidLeft]
Not willingly.[.6] My entire family simply[N]
watched as we lost the old war.[.6] They're[N]
all pathetic.[.6] They couldn't fight.[AN]
There's no 'glory' or 'valor' in battle[,][N]
there's only the clanking of steel and[N]
people falling to the ground.[AN]

blade or spear.[.6] It's in the blood.[AN][Clear]
