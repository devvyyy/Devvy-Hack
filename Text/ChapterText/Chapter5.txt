[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you for calling me here. This is quite[N]
a dire situation--[.4]my sincere apologies[,] but[N]
there is no time to scout ahead[,] Affogato.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
No[,] there isn't.[.6] But from my brief[N]
reconnoitering[,] I can tell you all the[N]
info we need.[AN]
The cliffs are overrun with brigands and[N]
sellswords without any magic[,] according[N]
to their armor.[AN]
They're in formation[,] and ready to engage[N]
us in battle.[.6] I think our current[N]
position is quite favorable.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
So there are brigands planning an ambush[,][N]
indeed.[.6] Unlike you[,] the rest of the[N]
army is not very sneaky[Beat][AN]
They are hoping to get a drop on us.[6N]
Inform the others.[.6] Stay on guard.[6N]
What matters now is how we react.[AN]

[MR][ClearFace][.6][LoadNoel]
Captain Brudet.[.6] Are we facing[Beat] sellswords?[6N]
What is the purpose of this axe[,] if not[N]
to cut down Aeterians?[AN]

[ML]
You are talented[,] Noel.[.6] It is a shame you[N]
can only find solace on the battlefield.[6N]
Will you continue to fight with us?[AN]

[MR]
Of course.[.6] My loyalty lies only to Wreyvine.[6N]
It is not through battle[,] but through[N]
Wreyvian piety that consoles me.[AN][Clear]
What are your orders[,] Captain?[AN]

[ML]
Get in position with the others[,] Noel.[6N]
We cannot afford to waste our opportunity.[AN]

[MR]
I will ready my blade at once[,] Captain Brudet.[.6][N]
Glory to the Great Flame.[AN][ClearFace]

Listen up,[.4] everyone.[AN]
Here's the rundown:[.4] the Aeterian duke gave[N]
us a pretty sweet deal--[.4]we just gotta[N]
deal with the Wreyvian knights,[AN]
and they'll give us a fortune while[N]
the Aeterian army does whatever on[N]
the other side of the hills.[AN]
I despise workin' with Aeterian vermin[,][N]
given what they did to our village[,] but[N]
we'll all be set for life![AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Oi,[.4] Kevron[,] chief.[.6] I'm not sure if[N]
this is such a good idea.[.6] I mean[,][N]
they're royal knights![an][Clear]
All we have is numbers[,] even if we do[N]
got a pretty large group 'ere.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Listen.[.6] We all gotta gamble a lil' sometimes[,] have a[N]
little risk in life[,] yeah?[.6] Especially[N]
when there's nothing else out here.[AN]
Try and live life once in a while--[.4][N]
or[,] heh[,] we won't be livin' at all.[6N]
It is what it is.[AN]
Wreyvine's got jack aside from harsh tundras[N]
and endless ores.[.6] We just gotta adapt[,][N]
use that steel for somethin' grand.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Alright,[.4] I trust you,[.4] boss.[6N]
[CloseEyes]I can already picture the payout[Beat] Rebuild[N]
our village that the Aeterians burned[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]

[OpenMidRight]
Don't get too ahead of yourself.[.6] They[N]
look like they have a few folks o' high[N]
rank with 'em.[AN]
In any case[,] this won't be an easy battle.[6N]
You're completely right:[.4] all we have[N]
on them are numbers.[AN]
But if we can surround 'em with reinforcements[,][N]

Weapons[,] medicine[,] provisions[Beat][N]
Everything should be ready[,] Captain.[6N]
The army is ready to march.[AN]

We must use this opportunity.[AN]
Wreyvine is home to perilous[,] unforgiving[N]

focus on--[.4]the soldier giving orders.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
Alright[,] Captain.[.6] I'll get everyone[N]
in position.[AN]

[FL]
It is advisable to stay on guard[,] even if we[N]
have a preemptive strike.[.6] We can attack[N]
with two forces split across the river.[AN]
It would certainly aid us in securing the[N]
villages.[.6] There is no greater duty for a[N]
knight than to aid their loyal citizens.[AN]

You're staring at the flowers like[N]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Pause]I used to come here a lot[Beat] Before[Beat][.6N]
It's not very far from the Great Bridge[N]
between Wreyvine and Aeteria.[AN]
It was a quick respite from the[N]
tiresome[,] constant battle.[6N]
My commander liked the flowers.[AN]
He said it was like Wreyvine itself;[.4][N]
[ToggleSmile]it's a miracle they grew at all in[N]

It's my turn to ask questions now.[6N]
I get you[,] sir.[.6] You're not from Wreyvine.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]How did[Beat][AN]

[ML]
How did an Aeterian soldier become[N]
a legendary Wreyvian knight?[AN]

[MR]
You're not usually one to ask questions[,][N]
Affogato.[.6] Is this really so[N]
important to you?[AN]

[ML]
No one else is here to listen.[AN]

[MR]
Then what are you getting at?[AN]

[ML]
I thought I remembered a few traces.[.6] I[N]
know I was headed towards the capital.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]Go on[,] then.[AN]

[ML]
I was sent here as[Beat] an Aeterian spy.[6N]
I never realized until I put it all[N]
together:[AN]
who my arrows were aimed for[,] what I[N]
was tasked to do.[.6] Aeteria sent me to[N]
scout around the king's court.[AN][Clear]
I was supposed to regroup with the division[N]
that was directly targetting the king[,][N]
and march towards the castle.[AN]

[MR]
I knew there was something off about you[,][N]
but[Beat] Why are you telling me this[,] [OpenQuote]Affogato"?[6N]
If you're really an Aeterian infiltrator.[AN]

[ML]
Because you're trustworthy.[.6] I don't feel any[N]
attachment or allegiance to Aeteria.[.6] I want[N]
to see Wreyvine persist through this war.[AN]
And[Beat] Before I came here[,] I was attacked[N]
and lost my memories in the process.[6N]
There's nothing tying me to Aeteria.[AN][Clear]
I need someone like a former Aeterian soldier[N]
to help me.[.6]  Will you help me recover[N]
the rest of them[,] [OpenQuote]Ulrich"?[AN]

[MR]
That's true[,] you're with the Wreyvian army.[.6][N]
But still[,] attacked by[Beat] what?[6N]

[ML]
I'd need to think on that.[.6] But I[N]
know you won't.[AN]

[MR]
What[,] are you going to turn on us now?[AN]

[ML]
No.[.6] I'm fine with my current position.[.6][N]
I'm satisfied working with the 7th Platoon[,][N]
even if I fear it may not last very long.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]And when the time comes?[.6] What will[N]
you do then?[.6] There's noth-[AN]

I made a promise[,] sir.[.6] One last promise.[.6][N]
That's the final core I can remember.[.6][N]
But I know I need to fulfill it.[AN]

How[Beat] falsified are your records?[AN]
Do you even remember your name?[AN]

[ML]
[Pause]I'll make sure to let you know when I[N]
figure it out[,] [OpenQuote]lieutenant".[AN]

You have my thanks[,] Captain.[6N]
With every Aeterian slain by my axe[,][N]
the closer I walk towards absolution.[AN]

[ML]
Noel.[.6] I understand your yearning for[N]
revenge[,] but do not let it consume you.[6N]
You will become hollow if you continue[AN]
to distance yourself from your ideals.[AN]

[MR]
I won't[,] Captain.[.6] Thanks.[.6] This[N]
task[,] however, seems rather easy;[.4]
yet between it all,[AN]
I don't want to lose myself[,] lest[N]
Kenneth's sacrifice was for naught.[AN]

[ML]
Revenge is purely self-serving.[.6][N]
You are taking it for another[N]
being's sake[,] yes,[AN]
but you do not consider their thoughts[N]
on the matter or the consequences[N]
for doing so.[AN]
Are you taking your rage out on one[N]
set Aeterian soldier[,] or the entire[N]
Aeterian empire?[AN]
Aeteria's soldiers are dangerous.[.6] They[N]
will show no remorse in your vulnerable[N]
moments of grief and pain.[AN][Clear]
In battle[,] you cannot afford to be distracted[N]
by feelings of retribution.[AN]

[MR]
The empire was responsible for my[N]
fiance's death.[.6] As it stands[,][N]
they will all pay for their crimes.[AN]

[MR]
Captain Brudet.[.6] With the army growing[N]
in numbers[,] have you ever felt[Beat][N]
inadequate compared to your peers?[AN]
I know that it's pathetic[,] but I[N]
can't help but feel competitive[,][N]
even subconsciously.[.6] Ugh.[AN]

[ML]
Eisner[,] you never seemed like one to[N]
have such rational fears.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]The hell is that supposed to mean?[AN]

[ML]
Excuse me.[.6] It is only natural to feel[N]
that way[,] especially in the chaos[N]
of warfare.[AN]
But to respond to your question[,] I have.[6N]
I see my men learning and teaching[N]
without my assistance,[AN]
and although I am proud[,] I cannot[N]
help but feel indolent.[AN]

[MR]
Tsch.[.6] But you strive for perfection[,][N]
don't you?[.6] If they can work perfectly[N]
fine without you,[AN]
then you get more time to focus[N]
on yourself.[AN]

[ML]
It is my perfectionism that drives me[N]
towards such feelings.[.6] I was not[N]
appointed a Captain out of skill[AN]
or battle achievements[,] but rather purely[N]
by my bloodline.[.6] I must be perfect[N]
to my peers,[AN]
lest I be overshadowed and deemed a burden.[AN]

[MR]
That's a little extreme.[.6] Do you really[N]
feel this way?[.6] I get it[,] but[Beat]

[ML]
We cannot control such feelings[,] Eisner.[6N]
But we must not let it take over[,][N]
especially not in battle.[AN][Clear]
You never know when an arrow or[N]
sword will find your back.[AN]

[ML]
Pardon my intrusion[,] Father Floris.[6N]
You were a knight of Wreyvine[,] correct?[6N]
You must have fought in the old war.[AN]

[MR]
Right.[.6] Ironically enough[,] I fought in the[N]
Holy War not as a holy man[,] but as a[N]
simple foot infantry with a spear.[AN]

[ML]
I always found it curious how a man of[N]
your frame was a simple priest.[.6] Why[N]
did you turn to the holy guard?[AN]

[MR]
I was foolish.[.6] It was my diffidence that[N]
made me join the royal guard.[.6] I wanted to[N]
prove my brother wrong and reassure myself.[AN]
He was a valorous man[,] and[,] in truth[,][N]
I was envious of the attention he held.[6N]
So I picked a spear and trained.[AN][Clear]
[Pause]Yet in a cruel twist of fate[,] the[N]
disposable soldier is the one who survived[N]
the old war.[AN]

[ML]
The path of a royal knight is a just one.[6N]
His tales of courage are still told[N]
today[,] Father.[AN]
I know that I must survive this war.[6N]
One day[,] I hope I can pass down my[N]
skills and experience.[AN]

[MR]
I'd wish to do the same[,] yet picking up[N]
a spear and fighting is much harder with[N]
these injuries[Beat][AN][Clear]
All I can do is pass down my teachings[N]
before my ailment brings me back to[N]
the Great Flame.[AN]
Every dawn[,] the blight spreads the eye.[N]
I'm afraid my time may be shorter than[N]
you lot[,] Captain[Beat][AN]

[ML]
Father Floris[,] I[Beat] I cannot imagine what[N]
you are going through.[.6] But even so[,][N]
my[Beat] No[,] it is not my place.[AN]

I fear that it would be best for you[N]
to[Beat] leave the army.[AN]

[MR]
You want me to quit and abandon you all?[6N]
Captain Brudet[Beat][AN]

[ML]
It is clear that you are in no condition to[N]
battle in times of war.[.6] You[Beat] deteriorate[N]
with lapses and throes each passing day[Beat][AN]
When my mother fell[,] it was not in a grand[N]
battle of honor and glory.[.6] Rather[,] she[N]
fell ill and[Beat] silently died.[AN]
With your ailment[,] I think it would be[N]
the best for your well-being if you lived[N]
your years in peace[,] free and fulfilled.[AN]

[MR]
At times of war?![.6] That'd be wrong.[6N]
I would rather die in battle or sickness[N]
than bear the guilt that would plague me.[AN]
And even if I did leave[Beat] You'd be naive[N]
to believe there's any guarantee of peace[N]
with all the Aeterians running about.[AN]

[ML]
I suppose that is an impossibility.[6N]
But even so[Beat] I want you to live[N]
the rest of your years in fulfillment.[AN]

[MR]
Fulfillment for me comes from helping the[N]
people[,] whether that is aiding my allies[N]
or performing one's rites.[AN]
What we have may be fleeting[,] but as[N]
unholy as it sounds[,] I'd never be[N]
satisfied if I wasn't here.[AN]

[ML]
To think a man of the cloth would resign[N]
to damnation[Beat] I am sorry.[.6] I[Beat][N]
do not know what to say[Beat][AN]

[MR]
In repentance[,] I've accepted it a long time[N]
ago[,] even back when I fought in the[N]
Holy War.[.6] Time never waits for anyone.[AN]
Until the bell tolls[,] I will never falter.[6N]
I'll do everything in my power to make[N]

ya know.[AN]
I stole a few gruel for my ill sister[,][N] 
but it didn't matter 'cause she died[n]
before I got outta jail.[AN]
The city guard caught me under their[N]
bloody 'protocol'[,] but I gave[N]
'em a last-ditch offer:[AN]
I'll do the dirty work that nobody else[n]
wants to do if they don't hang me[N]
on the spot like some heretical mage.[AN][Clear]
And they gladly accepted[Beat] as long[N]
as I returned to my cell each night.[AN]

soldier story again?[.6] And then that's[N]

[ML]
Yup.[.6] And ya know what Wreyvine did?[6N]
They sent me to the front lines as a soldier[N]
with none but a broken axe and tatters.[AN] 
Ya can't trust anyone 'ere[,] ya know.[6N]
And that ain't my liquid courage speakin'.[6N]
Ya know who cleaved his way out?[AN]

to death in the cold[,] or silently hanging[N]
from the gallows.[AN][Clear]
We're all shivered dead in Wreyvine[,][N]
some of us just get lucky and get out.[AN]

[MR]
Four years of working as a city guard[,][N]

Are you well?[.6] I understand that you[N]

I mean[Beat] I'm a scout.[.6] It's usually[N]

But that's not what's been bothering me.[6N]
I've been told my entire life that Aeterians[N]

[MR]
I have always taught you to act by the book.[6N]
We do not question the systems in place.[6N]
Aeterians are dangerous--[.4]this war proves it.[AN]
If you do not follow the structure[,] then[N]
I cannot help you.[.6] See to it that[N]

The Aeterian commanders are so convinced[N]

It is most certainly a thinly-veiled excuse[N]

My mother fought in the old war.[.6] My[N]
