Everything should be ready,[.4] sir.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We're ready for the march ahead,[.4][N]
then?[AN]
The scouts should be[N]
returning soon[Beat][A][X]

## Ch5OpeningEnemyMoment
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier][OpenMidRight][LoadKevron]
[OpenMidRight]Listen up,[.4] everyone.[.6][N]
Here's the rundown:[AN]
These men in robes gave[N]
us a pretty sweet deal-[AN]
We just have to deal with the[N]
royal knights,[AN]
and they're give us[N]
a fortune.[AN]
We'll all be set[N]
for life.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Kevron,[.4] I'm not sure if[N]
this is such a good idea.[AN]
They're royal knights-[.4] not to mention[N]
how suspicious the deal is.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Listen.[.6] We all gotta[N]
gamble sometimes.[AN]
Live life once in a while-[.4][N]
or we won't be livin' at all.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright,[.4] I trust[N]
you,[.4] boss.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]They look like they have the[N]
Captains with 'em.[AN]
This won't be an easy[N]
battle.[AN]
If we can storm them with[N]
reinforcements,[AN]
along with the fancy horseslayers[N]
and all,[AN]
I'm sure they'll be crushed[N]
under our heel.[A][X]

[OpenLeft]Captain Atheya,[.4] [MoveLeft]what do you see[N]
up there?![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][Beat]Affogato?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadAtheya]
[OpenMidRight]For the last time,[.4][MoveMidRight] shouting[N]
breaks the recon[Beat]![AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Er,[.4] right.[.6][N]
[CloseEyes]Sorry.[AN][OpenEyes][Event]
[OpenMidRight]Anyways,[.4] what looks to be[N]
hostile sellswords lurk in the cliffside.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]So it's an ambush?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Precisely.[AN]
[OpenLeft]But how would they know[N]
we were here?[AN]
[OpenLeft]Somebody may have overheard[N]
last night's conversation.[AN]
But it doesn't matter now.[.6][N]
What matters is how we react.[A][X]

## Ch5Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich][OpenRight][LoadAtheya][OpenFarRight][LoadMocha]
[OpenRight]Prepare everybody for[N]
battle.[AN]
Brigands and sellswords have been[N]
spotted down south.[AN]
They lie in wait-[.4] we should use[N]
this as an opportunity.[AN] 
[OpenMidLeft]Alright[.4] I'll get[N]
everyone in position.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]M[.4]-may I have[N]
a word?[AN]
[OpenRight]We're listening.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]I think we should attack[N]
with two forces.[AN]
The forces could be on different[N]
sides of the river.[AN]
It would aid us in securing[N]
the villages nearby.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm.[.6] I'll inform[N]
the others.[AN]
[OpenRight]If there's nothing else[N]
to be said,[AN]
let's move.[.6] Wouldn't want to[N]
keep them waiting,[.4] right?[A][X]

## Ch5OpeningAlt3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich][OpenMidRight][LoadAffo]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Ulrich![.6] Rally everyone[N]
for battle.[AN]
I've spotted brigands[N]
down south.[AN]
We have an opportunity to attack:[N]
They are planning an ambush.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright,[.4] I'll rally the[N]
others.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]And the terrain around[N]
here[Beat][AN]
I think it would be wise to[N]
move in two forces.[AN]
They'll have less of a chance[N]
to react if we're on both sides[AN]
of the river.[.6] What do you[N]
think?[.6] Good idea?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][Pause]Sure.[.6] We move now,[.4] while[N]
we still have the chance.[A][X]

## Ch5Ending1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffo][OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidRight]This is another victory[N]
for Wreyvine's royal guard.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Seems like it,[.4] huh?[AN]
We should use this opportunity[N]
to rest at the nearby village.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We may be able to glean[N]
imformation from the locals,[.4] too.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Okay,[.4] let's go.[A][X]

## Ch5Ending2
[OpenMidRight][LoadAffo][OpenMidLeft][LoadMoneyman]
[OpenMidLeft][Pause][ToggleSmile]Yes.[.6] [ToggleSmile]That's what I[N]
believe,[.4] too.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The only way the Keepers can[N]
operate is if they're stationed[AN]
somewhere nearby.[.6] They can't[N]
hide for long.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmm[.4] yes.[.6] That does[N]
add up with the captain's report.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadGingerWoman]
[OpenFarLeft]You're not the only one whose[N]
asked us about the shamans.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[.6] How could[N]
that be?[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]A man with a blue coat came[N]
by yesterday.[AN]
He asked us similar[N]
questions.[AN]
I'd watch my back out[N]
there,[.4] hunter.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Got it.[.6] I'll keep my[N]
eye out.[AN][MoveFarRight][X]

[OpenMidRight][Beat]We must move.[.6] There is[N]
no time to waste.[AN]
We must head directly towards[N]

The more Keepers we meet,[.4] there's a[N]

It makes my heart feel[Beat][N]

A voice that I can't seem[N]

[OpenMidRight][Pause]Go on.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]One is telling me the[N]
Keepers are dangerous.[AN]
Obvious enough,[.4] right?[.6][N]
They're our enemy.[AN]
Yet another[Beat] It's though[N]
as if they were[Beat] kin?[AN]
Like a hunter- a wolf,[.4] separated[N]

But Affogato,[.4] know that[N]
you aren't alone here.[AN]
