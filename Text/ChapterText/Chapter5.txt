[OpenMidRight]Weapons,[.4] medicine,[.4] provisions.[.6][N]
Everything should be ready,[.4] sir.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]We're ready for the march ahead,[.4][N]
then?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Captain Brudet told us to wait here[N]
until the scouting is finished.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Well,[.4] the scouts should be[N]
returning soon[Beat][A][X]

## Ch5OpeningEnemyMoment
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBandit][OpenMidRight][LoadKevron]
[OpenMidRight]Listen up,[.4] everyone.[.6][N]
Here's the rundown:[AN]
The Aeterians gave us a[N]
pretty sweet deal-[AN]
We just have to deal with the[N]
Wreyvian knights,[AN]
and they'll give us[N]
a fortune.[AN]
We'll all be set[N]
for life.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Oi,[.4] Kevron.[.6] I'm not sure if[N]
this is such a good idea.[AN]
They're royal knights.[.6] All we have[N]
is numbers-[.6] and barely at that.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Listen.[.6] We all gotta[N]
gamble sometimes.[AN]
Live life once in a while-[.4][N]
or we won't be livin' at all.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright,[.4] I trust[N]
you,[.4] boss.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]They look like they have the[N]
captains with 'em.[AN]
This won't be an easy[N]
battle.[AN]
If we can storm them with[N]
reinforcements,[AN]
along with the fancy horse-killer-er[N]
things and all that fancy stuff,[AN]
I'm sure they'll be crushed[N]
under our heel.[A][X]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadMocha][OpenLeft][LoadAffogato]
[OpenLeft]Captain Brudet,[.4] [MoveLeft]what do you see[N]
up there?![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][Beat]Affogato.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadAtheya]
[OpenMidRight]For the last time,[.4][MoveMidRight] shouting[N]
breaks the recon[Beat]![AN]
[OpenLeft]Er,[.4] right.[.6][N]
[CloseEyes]Sorry.[AN][OpenEyes][Event]
[OpenMidRight]Anyways,[.4] what looks to be hostile[N]
sellswords lurk in the cliffside.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]So it's an ambush?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Precisely.[AN]
[OpenLeft]But how would they know[N]
we were here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We aren't exactly the sneakiest[N]
army,[.4] you know.[AN]
But it doesn't matter now.[.6][N]
What matters is how we react.[A][X]

## Ch5OpeningAlt2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffogato][OpenMidRight][LoadBrudet]
[OpenMidLeft][Pause]So,[.4] did you see anything[N]
up there?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]What looks to be hostile sellswords[N]
lurk in the cliffside.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]So you're saying it's[N]
an ambush?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Precisely.[.6] We should stay on guard,[.4][N]
and inform the others.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]How would they know we[N]
were here?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We aren't exactly the sneakiest[N]
army,[.4] you know.[AN]
But it doesn't matter now.[.6][N]
What matters is how we react.[A][X]

## Ch5Opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich][OpenRight][LoadAtheya][OpenFarRight][LoadMocha]
[OpenRight]Prepare everybody for[N]
battle.[AN]
Brigands and sellswords have been[N]
spotted down south.[AN]
They lie in wait-[.4] we should use[N]
this as an opportunity.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright[.4] I'll get[N]
everyone in position.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]May I have a[N]
quick word?[AN]
[OpenRight]We're listening.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]I think we should attack[N]
with two forces.[AN]
The forces could be on different[N]
sides of the river.[AN]
It would aid us in securing[N]
the villages nearby.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm.[.6] I'll inform[N]
the others.[AN]
[OpenRight]If there's nothing else[N]
to be said,[AN]
let's move.[.6] Wouldn't want to[N]
keep them waiting,[.4] right?[A][X]

## Ch5OpeningAlt3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich][OpenRight][LoadBrudet][OpenFarRight][LoadAffo]
[OpenFarRight]Sir Ulrich![.6] Rally everyone[N]
for battle.[AN]
[OpenRight]There's brigands and mercenaries[N]
down south.[AN]
We have an opportunity to attack:[.4][N]
they are planning an ambush.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright,[.4] I'll rally the[N]
others.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]And the terrain around[N]
here[Beat][AN]
I think it would be wise to[N]
move in two forces.[AN]
They'll have less of a chance[N]
to react if we're on both sides[AN]
of the river.[.6] What do you[N]
think?[.6] Good idea?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][Pause]Sure.[.6] We move now,[.4] while[N]
we still have the chance.[A][X]

## Ch5Ending1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffo][OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidRight]This is another victory[N]
for Wreyvine's royal guard.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Seems like it,[.4] huh?[AN]
We should use this opportunity[N]
to rest at the nearby village.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We may be able to glean[N]
imformation from the locals,[.4] too.[AN]
Perhaps they've heard whim of[N]
Aeteria's invasion.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Okay,[.4] let's go.[A][X]

## Ch5Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMoneyman][OpenMidRight][LoadAffo]
[OpenMidLeft][Pause][ToggleSmile]Yes.[.6] [ToggleSmile]That's what I[N]
believe,[.4] too.[AN]
Yet if one of the twin kingdom got both[N]
relics,[.4] the results will be ruinous.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Really?[.6] I'm not too interested in[N]
lore or anything[Beat][AN]
but that does seem like[N]
a scary thought.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Mmmhmm.[.6] With both twin relics,[.4] a[N]
kingdom can rebirth.[AN]
[Pause]Leaving the other twin kingdom[N]
to drift into oblivion.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Uh,[.4] that's[Beat] not good.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes,[.4] indeed.[.6] I'd watch my back[N]
out there,[.4] young hunter.[AN]
And here,[.4] take this for[N]
your troubles.[AN]
The villagers wanted to[N]
give their thanks.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Thanks.[.6] I'll keep my[N]
eye out.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveFarFarRight][ClearFace][X]
