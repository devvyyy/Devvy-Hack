[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat]Thank you for calling me here. This is quite[N]
a dire situation--[.4]my sincere apologies[,] but[N]
there's no time to scout ahead[,] Affogato.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
No[,] there isn't.[.6] But from my brief[N]
reconnoitering[,] I can tell you all the[N]
info we need.[AN]
The cliffs are overrun with brigands[N]
and sellswords[,] according to[N]
their armor.[AN]
They're in formation[,] and ready to[N]
engage us in battle.[.6] I think our[N]
position is quite favorable.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
So there are brigands planning an ambush[,][N]
indeed.[.6] Our army is generally not[N]
very sneaky[,] you see[Beat][AN]
So they are hoping to get a drop on us.[6N]
Inform the others.[.6] Stay on guard.[6N]
What matters now is how we react.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadBandit][OpenMidRight][LoadKevron]
[OpenMidRight]Listen up,[.4] everyone.[.6][AN]
Here's the rundown:[.4] the Aeterian duke gave[N]
us a pretty sweet deal--[.4]we just gotta[N]
deal with the Wreyvian knights,[AN]
and they'll give us a fortune while[N]
the Aeterian army does whatever on[N]
the other side of the hills.[AN][Clear]
We'll all be set for life![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oi,[.4] Kevron.[.6] I'm not sure if[N]
this is such a good idea.[.6] I mean[,][N]
They're royal knights.[an][Clear]
All we have is numbers[,] even if we[N]
do got a large group 'ere.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]Listen.[.6] We all gotta[N]
gamble sometimes[,] have a[N]
little risk in life.[AN][Clear]
Live life once in a while--[.4][N]
or we won't be livin' at all.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright,[.4] I trust[N]
you,[.4] boss.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]They look like they have a few[N]
folks o' high rank with 'em.[.6N]
This won't be an easy battle.[AN]
If we can surround them with reinforcements[,][N]
along with the fancy horse-killer-er[N]
things and all that fancy stuff,[AN][Clear]
I'm sure they'll be crushed[N]
under our heel anyhow.[A][X]

Sir Ulrich[,] the scouts have spotted brigands[N]
and sellswords down south.[.6] They lie[N]
in waiting below.[AN]

[FR]
Weapons[,] medicine[,] provisions[Beat][N]
Everything should be ready[,] Captain.[6N]
The army is ready to march.[AN]

[FL]
We must use this opportunity.[AN]
Wreyvine is home to perilous[,] unforgiving[N]
cold lands.[.6] Mercenaries are all the same:[AN]
the moment we take out their superior[,][N]
they have nothing.[.6] That is what we must[N]
focus on:[.4] the soldier giving orders.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
Alright[,] Captain.[.6] I'll get everyone[N]
in position.[AN]

[FL]
It is advisable to stay on guard[,] even if we[N]
have a preemptive strike.[.6] We can attack[N]
with two forces split across the river.[AN]
It would certainly aid us in securing the[N]
villages.[.6] There is no greater duty for a[N]
knight than to aid their loyal citizens.[AN] 

[OpenFarRight]
Yes[,] let's begin.[.6] If there's nothing else[N]
to be said[,] then let's move.[.6] We[N]
wouldn't want to keep them waiting.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
You're staring at the flowers like[N]
they're made of the finest gold.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Pause]I used to come here a lot[Beat] Before[Beat][.6N]
It's not very far from the Great Bridge[N]
between Wreyvine and Aeteria.[AN]
It was a quick respite from the[N]
tiresome[,] constant battle.[6N]
My commander liked the flowers.[AN]
He said it was like Wreyvine itself;[.4][N]
[ToggleSmile]it's a miracle they grew at all in[N]
this poor climate[,] haha.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Wreyvine's lands are much harsher than the[N]
rich grounds of Aeteria.[.6] Many people[N]
here don't make it.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Your mind seems preoccupied.[AN]

[ML]
I could say the same to you.[6N]
You don't feel cold at all?[.6N]
You don't have any doubts[,] Affogato?[AN]

[MR]
I'm not very concerned[,] no.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
How are you so untroubled all the time[,][N]
despite our constant battling?[6N]
This war seems impossible.[AN][Clear]
[Pause]And how do you trace Aeterian battle[N]
tactics so clearly?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Observation.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
If you say so.[.6] More importantly[,] are[N]
you ready for what's up ahead?[6N]
Will you stay with us?[AN][Clear]
I've lived this same war twenty-four[N]
years ago.[.6] None of us are ready[N]
for what's coming.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Perhaps we should discuss this after[N]
the battle is over.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Pause]No.[.6] Drop it entirely.[AN]

[MR]

[ML]
How did an Aeterian soldier become[N]
a legendary Wreyvian knight?[AN]

[MR]
You're not usually one to ask questions[,][N]
Affogato.[.6] Is this really so[N]
important to you[Beat]?[AN]

[ML]
It's just the two of us here.[.6] Your[N]
secret is my secret.[AN]

[MR]
What are you getting at?

[ML]
I recovered a few traces of my memory.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[ML]
I was sent here as an Aeterian spy.[AN]

[MR]
I had the suspicion[,] but[Beat][N]
Why are you telling me this?[AN]

[ML]
You're very trustworthy.[.6] I was attacked[N]
and lost my memories in the process.[6N]
Will you help me recover them?[AN]

[MR]
You[Beat] That explains a lot.[.6][N]
What[,] are you going to turn on us now?[AN]

[ML]
No[,] of course not.[.6] I'm fine with[N]
my current position.[.6] But I fear[N]
it won't last very long.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat]And when the time comes?[AN]

[ML]
I made a promise.[.6] One last promise.[.6][N]
That's all I remember.[.6] But I know[N]
I need to fulfill it.[AN]

[MR]
How falsified are your records?[AN]
Is Affogato really your name?[AN]
