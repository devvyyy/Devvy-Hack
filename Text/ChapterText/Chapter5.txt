[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat]Thank you for calling me here. This is quite[N]
a dire situation--my sincere apologies[,] but[N]
there's no time to scout ahead[,] Affogato.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
No[,] there isn't. But from my brief reconnoitering[,][N]
I can tell you all the info we needL[.4] that the cliff[N]
sides are overrun with brigands and sellswords[,][AN]
according to their armor.[.6] They're in formation[,][N]
ready to engage us in battle.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
So there are brigands planning an ambush[,][N]
indeed.[.6] Our army is generally not[N]
very sneaky[,] you see[Beat][AN]
So they are hoping to get a drop on us.[6N]
Inform the others.[.6] Stay on guard.[6N]
What matters now is how we react.[AN]

## Ch5OpeningEnemyMoment
# yo move this to turn 1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBandit][OpenMidRight][LoadKevron]
[OpenMidRight]Listen up,[.4] everyone.[.6][N]
Here's the rundown:[AN]
The Aeterian duke gave us a[N]
pretty sweet deal-[AN]
We just have to deal with the[N]
Wreyvian knights,[AN]
and they'll give us[N]
a fortune.[AN]
We'll all be set[N]
for life.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Oi,[.4] Kevron.[.6] I'm not sure if[N]
this is such a good idea.[AN]
They're royal knights.[.6] All we have[N]
is numbers--[.4]and barely at that.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Listen.[.6] We all gotta[N]
gamble sometimes.[AN]
Live life once in a while-[.4][N]
or we won't be livin' at all.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright,[.4] I trust[N]
you,[.4] boss.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]They look like they have the[N]
captains with 'em.[AN]
This won't be an easy[N]
battle.[AN]
If we can storm them with[N]
reinforcements,[AN]
along with the fancy horse-killer-er[N]
things and all that fancy stuff,[AN]
I'm sure they'll be crushed[N]
under our heel.[A][X]

[ML][LoadBrudet][OpenLeft][LoadAffogato][OpenFarRight][LoadUlrich]

[ML]
Sir Ulrich[,] the scouts have spotted brigands and[N]
sellswords down south.[.6] They lie in wait--[.4N]
we should use this as an opportunity.[AN]
Wreyvine is home to perilous[,] unforgiving[N]
cold lands. Mercenaries are all the same--[.4N]
the moment we take out their superior[,][AN]
they have nothing.[.6] That is what we must[N]
focus on:[.6] the soldier giving orders.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
Alright[,] Captain.[.6] I'll get everyone in position.[AN]

[ML]
It is advisable to stay on guard[,] even if we have a[N]
preemptive strike.[.6] We can attack with two forces[,][N]
with one on each side of the river.[AN]
It would certainly aid us in securing the[N]
villages.[.6] There is no greater duty for a[N]
knight than to aid their loyal citizens.[AN] 

[OpenLeft]
Weapons[,] medicine[,] provisions[Beat][N]
Everything should be ready[,] Captain.[6N]
The army is ready to march.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
Yes[,] let's begin.[.6] If there's nothing else[N]
to be said[,][A] then let's move.[.6] We[N]
wouldn't want to keep them waiting.[AN]
