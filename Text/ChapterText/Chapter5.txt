[OpenLeft]Captain,[.4] [MoveLeft]what do you see[N]
up there?![AN]
[OpenFarLeft][Beat]Affogato?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][LoadAtheya]
[OpenMidRight]For the last time,[.4][MoveMidRight] shouting[N]

[OpenFarLeft]Er,[.4] right.[.6][N]
[CloseEyes]Sorry.[AN][OpenEyes][Event]
[OpenMidRight]Anyways,[.4] what looks to be[N]
hostiles lurk in the cliffside.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]So it's an ambush?[AN]
Precisely.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]But how would they know[N]
we were here?[AN]
[OpenLeft]Somebody may have overheard[N]
last night's conversation.[AN]
But it doesn't matter now.[.6][N]
What matters is how we react.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich][OpenRight][LoadAtheya][OpenFarRight][LoadMocha]
[OpenRight]Prepare everybody for[N]
battle.[AN]
Brigands have been spotted[N]
down south.[AN]
They lie in wait-[.4] we should use[N]
this as an opportunity.[AN] 
[OpenMidLeft]Alright[.4] I'll get[N]
everyone in position.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]M[.4]-may I have[N]
a word?[AN]
[OpenRight]We're listening.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]I think we should attack[N]
with two forces.[AN]
The forces could be on different[N]
sides of the river.[AN]
It would aid us in securing[N]
the villages nearby.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm[.6] I'll inform[N]
the others.[AN]
[OpenRight]If there's nothing else[N]
to be said,[AN]
let's move.[.6] Wouldn't want to[N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadUlrich][OpenMidRight][LoadAffo]
[OpenMidRight]Sir Ulrich![.6] Rally everyone[N]

I've spotted brigands[N]
down south.[AN]
We have an opportunity to attack:[N]
They are planning an ambush.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright[.4] I'll rally the[N]
others.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]And the terrain around[N]
here[Beat][AN]
I think it would be wise to[N]
move in two forces.[AN]
They'll have less of a chance[N]
to react if we're on both sides[AN]
of the river.[.6] What do you[N]
think?[.6] Good idea?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][Pause]Sure.[.6] We move now,[.4] while[N]
we still have the chance.[A][X]

## Ch5Ending1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAffo][OpenMidRight][LoadUlrich]
[OpenMidRight]This is another victory[N]
for Wreyvine's royal guard.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Seems like it,[.4] huh?[AN]
We should use this opportunity[N]
to rest at the nearby village.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]We may be able to glean[N]
imformation from the locals,[.4] too.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Okay,[.4] let's go.[A][X]

## Ch5Ending2
[OpenMidRight][LoadAffo][OpenMidLeft][LoadMoneyman]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes.[.6] That's what I[N]
believe,[.4] too.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The only way the Keepers can[N]
operate is if they're stationed[AN]
somewhere nearby.[.6] They can't[N]
hide for long.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmm[.4] yes.[.6] That does[N]
add up with the captain's report.[AN]
Say,[.4] how's His Majesty[N]
doing,[.4] lad?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]The King?[.6] I'm not too sure-[.4][N]
I've not been a knight for long.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I see.[.6] His Majesty has always[N]
been an enigmatic one.[AN]
Always clad in that suit of his,[.4][N]
like[.4] a really[.6] shiny[.6] statue.[AN]
Give him my regards,[.4][N]
young hunter![AN]
[OpenMidRight]Mm,[.4] will do,[.4] sir.[A][X]
