[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you for calling me here. This is quite[N]
a dire situation--[.4]my sincere apologies[,] but[N]
there is no time to scout ahead[,] Affogato.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
No[,] there isn't.[.6] But from my brief[N]
reconnoitering[,] I can tell you all the[N]
info we need.[AN]
The cliffs are overrun with brigands and[N]
sellswords without any magic[,] according[N]
to their armor.[AN]
They're in formation[,] and ready to engage[N]
us in battle.[.6] I think our current[N]
position is quite favorable.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
So there are brigands planning an ambush[,][N]
indeed.[.6] Unlike you[,] the rest of the[N]
army is not very sneaky[Beat][AN]
They are hoping to get a drop on us.[6N]
Inform the others.[.6] Stay on guard.[6N]
What matters now is how we react.[AN]

[MR][ClearFace][.6][LoadNoel]
Captain Brudet.[.6] Are we facing[Beat] sellswords?[6N]
What is the purpose of this axe[,] if not[N]
to cut down Aeterians?[AN]

[ML]
You are talented[,] Noel.[.6] It is a shame you[N]
can only find solace on the battlefield.[6N]
Will you continue to fight with us?[AN]

[MR]
Of course.[.6] My loyalty lies only to Wreyvine.[6N]
It is not through battle[,] but through[N]
Wreyvian piety that consoles me.[AN][Clear]
What are your orders[,] Captain?[AN]

[ML]
Get in position with the others[,] Noel.[6N]
We cannot afford to waste our opportunity.[AN]

[MR]
I will ready my blade at once[,] Captain Brudet.[.6][N]
Glory to the Great Flame.[AN][ClearFace]

Listen up,[.4] everyone.[AN]
Here's the rundown:[.4] the Aeterian duke gave[N]
us a pretty sweet deal--[.4]we just gotta[N]
deal with the Wreyvian knights,[AN]
and they'll give us a fortune while[N]
the Aeterian army does whatever on[N]
the other side of the hills.[AN]
I despise workin' with Aeterian vermin[,][N]
given what they did to our village[,] but[N]
we'll all be set for life![AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Oi,[.4] Kevron[,] chief.[.6] I'm not sure if[N]
this is such a good idea.[.6] I mean[,][N]
they're royal knights![an][Clear]
All we have is numbers[,] even if we do[N]
got a pretty large group 'ere.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Listen.[.6] We all gotta gamble a lil' sometimes[,] have a[N]
little risk in life[,] yeah?[.6] Especially[N]
when there's nothing else out here.[AN]
Try and live life once in a while--[.4][N]
or[,] heh[,] we won't be livin' at all.[6N]
It is what it is.[AN]
Wreyvine's got jack aside from harsh tundras[N]
and endless ores.[.6] We just gotta adapt[,][N]
use that steel for somethin' grand.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Alright,[.4] I trust you,[.4] boss.[6N]
[CloseEyes]I can already picture the payout[Beat] Rebuild[N]
our village that the Aeterians burned[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]

[OpenMidRight]
Don't get too ahead of yourself.[.6] They[N]
look like they have a few folks o' high[N]
rank with 'em.[AN]
In any case[,] this won't be an easy battle.[6N]
You're completely right:[.4] all we have[N]
on them are numbers.[AN]
But if we can surround 'em with reinforcements[,][N]
along with all our fancy horse-killer-er[N]

in waiting below.[AN]

[FR]
Weapons[,] medicine[,] provisions[Beat][N]
Everything should be ready[,] Captain.[6N]
The army is ready to march.[AN]

[FL]
We must use this opportunity.[AN]
Wreyvine is home to perilous[,] unforgiving[N]
cold lands.[.6] Mercenaries are all the same.[AN]
the moment we take out their superior[,][N]
they have nothing.[.6] That is what we must[N]
focus on--[.4]the soldier giving orders.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
Alright[,] Captain.[.6] I'll get everyone[N]
in position.[AN]

[FL]
It is advisable to stay on guard[,] even if we[N]
have a preemptive strike.[.6] We can attack[N]
with two forces split across the river.[AN]
It would certainly aid us in securing the[N]
villages.[.6] There is no greater duty for a[N]
knight than to aid their loyal citizens.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
Yes[,] let's begin.[.6] If there's nothing else[N]

You're staring at the flowers like[N]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Pause]I used to come here a lot[Beat] Before[Beat][.6N]
It's not very far from the Great Bridge[N]

It was a quick respite from the[N]

He said it was like Wreyvine itself;[.4][N]
[ToggleSmile]it's a miracle they grew at all in[N]

This war seems impossible.[AN][Clear]

If you say so.[.6] More importantly[,] are[N]
you ready for what's up ahead?[6N]

How did an Aeterian soldier become[N]

You're not usually one to ask questions[,][N]

Nobody else is here to listen.[AN]

[MR]
What are you getting at?[AN]

I remember a few traces of my memory.[AN]

[MR]
[Beat][AN]

[ML]
I was sent here as[Beat] an Aeterian spy.[6N]
I never realized until I put it all[N]
together:[AN]
who my arrows were aimed for[,] what I[N]
was tasked to do.[.6] Aeteria sent me[N]
to assassinate the Wreyvian king.[AN][Clear]
I was supposed to regroup with the division[N]
that was directly targetting the king.[AN]

[MR]
I had the suspicion from our chats[,] but[Beat][N]
Why are you telling me this[,] [OpenQuote]Affogato"?[6N]
You're an Aeterian infiltrator.[AN]

[ML]
Because you're trustworthy.[.6] I was attacked[N]
and lost my memories in the process.[6N]
Will you help me recover the rest of them?[AN]

[MR]

But still[,] attacked by what?[6N]
Hell[,] what if I tell you 'no'?[AN]

to fight with our lives for our beloved[AN]

Eh[,] I don't get it.[.6] You were born noble.[6N]
I was just a criminal[,] then a headsman[,][N]

Aeterian empire?[AN]
Aeteria's soldiers are dangerous.[.6] They[N]

[MR]
Captain Brudet.[.6] With the army growing[N]
in numbers[,] have you ever felt[Beat][N]
inadequate compared to your peers?[AN]
I know that it's pathetic[,] but I[N]
can't help but feel competitive[,][N]
even subconsciously.[.6] Ugh.[AN]

[ML]
Eisner[,] you never seemed like one to[N]
have such rational fears.[AN]

[MR]
[Pause]The hell is that supposed to mean?[AN]

[ML]
Excuse me.[.6] It is only natural to feel[N]
that way[,] especially in the chaos[N]
of warfare.[AN]
But to respond to your question[,] I have.[6N]
I see my men learning and teaching[N]
without my assistance,[AN]
and although I am proud[,] I cannot[N]
help but feel indolent.[AN]

[MR]
Tsch.[.6] But you strive for perfection[,][N]
don't you?[.6] If they can work perfectly[N]
fine without you,[AN]
then you get more time to focus[N]
on yourself.[AN]

[ML]
It is my perfectionism that drives me[N]
towards such feelings.[.6] I was not[N]
appointed a Captain out of skill[AN]
or battle achievements[,] but rather purely[N]
by my bloodline.[.6] I must be perfect[N]
to my peers,[AN]
lest I be overshadowed and deemed a burden.[AN]

[MR]
That's a little extreme.[.6] Do you really[N]
feel this way?[.6] I get it[,] but[Beat]

[ML]
We cannot control such feelings[,] Eisner.[6N]
But we must not let it take over[,][N]
especially not in battle.[AN][Clear]
You never know when an arrow or[N]
sword will find your back.[AN]

This young man was stealing bread[,] so--[AN]

[ML]
You WHAT?![.6] Ya know what ya call[N]
a bread thief?[AN]

[MR]
A thief[Beat] who steals bread?[AN]

[ML]
Ya call 'em morally justified[,] mate.[AN]

[MR]
Are you really[Beat] on the side of the[N]
defendant?[.6] This was in accordance to[N]
the city guard protocol.[AN]

[ML]
Hell yeah.[.6] You can't just arrest people[N]
willy nilly like that[,] Doppy.[.6] Release[N]
that poor man from the slammer[,] damn it![AN]

[MR]
I've never seen you so passionate[N]
about bread before[Beat][AN]

[ML]
It's not about the damned bread[,] mate![6N]
It's about the MAN![.6] The MAN.[AN]

[MR]
Ohhhh[Beat] Uh[,] is this the start of[N]
another inebriated lecture?[AN]

[ML]
Ya hear?[.6] I was in a bind like him.[6N]
I didn't enlist out of Wreyvian pride[,][N]
ya know.[AN]
I stole a few gruel for my ill sister[,][N] 
but it didn't matter 'cause she died[n]
before I got outta jail.[AN]
The city guard caught me under their[N]
bloody 'protocol'[,] but I gave[N]
'em a last-ditch offer:[AN]
I'll do the dirty work that nobody else[n]
wants to do if they don't hang me[N]
on the spot like some heretical mage.[AN][Clear]
And they gladly accepted[Beat] as long[N]
as I returned to my cell each night.[AN]

[MR]
Remind me[,] is this the headsman or the[N]
soldier story again?[.6] And then that's[N]
when you broke out[,] I'm assuming.[AN]

[ML]
Yup.[.6] And ya know what Wreyvine did?[6N]
They sent me to the front lines as a soldier[N]
with none but a broken axe and tatters.[AN] 
Ya can't trust anyone 'ere[,] ya know.[6N]
And that ain't my liquid courage speakin'.[6N]
Ya know who cleaved his way out?[AN]
Me.[.6] My other options were quietly starvin'[N]
to death in the cold[,] or silently hanging[N]
from the gallows.[AN][Clear]
We're all shivered dead in Wreyvine[,][N]
some of us just get lucky and get out.[AN]

[MR]
Four years of working as a city guard[,][N]
and yet so much goes behind the scenes[N]
without me knowing[Beat][AN][Clear]
By the Hearthbringer[Beat] You never told[N]
me about these tales[,] Captain.[AN]

Ah![.6] C-[.4]Captain Brudet![.6] How are[Beat][N]
Uhm[,] you doing right now???[AN]

[MR]
Are you well?[.6] I understand that you[N]
must not be used to fighting[,] especially[N]
in an army against trained soldiers.[AN]

[ML]
I mean[Beat] I'm a scout.[.6] It's usually[N]
a solo endeavor.[.6] With[,] uhm[,] little[N]
fighting[,] if any.[AN]
But that's not what's been bothering me.[6N]
I've been told my entire life that Aeterians[N]
are the enemy.[.6] You taught me that[,] Captain.[AN]

[MR]
I have always taught you to act by the book.[6N]
We do not question the systems in place.[6N]
Aeterians are dangerous--[.4]this war proves it.[AN]
If you do not follow the structure[,] then[N]
I cannot help you.[.6] See to it that[N]
you can focus on the mission.[AN]

[ML]
The Aeterian commanders are so convinced[N]
they're doing the right thing[,] though![6N]
Do you think we killed their empress?[AN]

[MR]
It is most certainly a thinly-veiled excuse[N]
to invade[,] to conquer[,] to cast us further[N]
into the darkness[,] Mocha.[AN]
My mother fought in the old war.[.6] My[N]
grandfather fought in the battles prior.[6N]
Aeteria's deception will never waver.[AN]
If we do not push back now[,] the people[N]
of Wreyvine--[.4]our kin will never get[N]
the chance to see the pure daybreak.[AN][Clear]
Do you understand[,] Mocha?[.6] We act by[N]
the book for the future of all Wreyvians.[AN]
