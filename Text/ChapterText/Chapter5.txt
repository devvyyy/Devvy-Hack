[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you for calling me here. This is quite[N]
a dire situation--[.4]my sincere apologies[,] but[N]
there's no time to scout ahead[,] Affogato.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
No[,] there isn't.[.6] But from my brief[N]
reconnoitering[,] I can tell you all the[N]
info we need.[AN]
The cliffs are overrun with brigands and[N]
sellswords without any magic[,] according[N]
to their armor.[AN]
They're in formation[,] and ready to[N]
engage us in battle.[.6] I think our[N]
position is quite favorable.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
So there are brigands planning an ambush[,][N]
indeed.[.6] Unlike you[,] the rest of the[N]
army is not very sneaky[Beat][AN]
They are hoping to get a drop on us.[6N]
Inform the others.[.6] Stay on guard.[6N]
What matters now is how we react.[AN]

[MR][ClearFace][.6][LoadNoel]
Captain Brudet.[.6] Are we facing[Beat] sellswords?[6N]
What is the purpose of this axe[,] if not[N]
to cut down Aeterians?[AN]

[ML]
You are talented[,] Noel.[.6] It is a shame you[N]
can only find solace on the battlefield.[6N]
Will you continue to fight with us?[AN]

[MR]
Of course.[.6] My loyalty lies only to Wreyvine.[6N]
It is not through battle[,] but through[N]
Wreyvian piety that consoles me.[AN][Clear]
What are your orders[,] Captain?[AN]

[ML]
Get in position with the others[,] Noel.[6N]
We cannot afford to waste our opportunity.[AN]

[MR]
I will ready my blade at once[,] Captain Brudet.[.6][N]
Glory to the Great Flame.[AN][ClearFace]

[OpenMidRight]Listen up,[.4] everyone.[.6][AN]
Here's the rundown:[.4] the Aeterian duke gave[N]
us a pretty sweet deal--[.4]we just gotta[N]
deal with the Wreyvian knights,[AN]
and they'll give us a fortune while[N]
the Aeterian army does whatever on[N]
the other side of the hills.[AN][Clear]
We'll all be set for life![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oi,[.4] Kevron.[.6] I'm not sure if[N]
this is such a good idea.[.6] I mean[,][N]
They're royal knights.[an][Clear]
All we have is numbers[,] even if we[N]
do got a large group 'ere.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]Listen.[.6] We all gotta[N]
gamble sometimes[,] have a[N]
little risk in life.[AN][Clear]
Live life once in a while--[.4][N]
or we won't be livin' at all.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright,[.4] I trust[N]
you,[.4] boss.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]They look like they have a few[N]
folks o' high rank with 'em.[.6N]
This won't be an easy battle.[AN]

in waiting below.[AN]

[FR]
Weapons[,] medicine[,] provisions[Beat][N]
Everything should be ready[,] Captain.[6N]
The army is ready to march.[AN]

[FL]
We must use this opportunity.[AN]
Wreyvine is home to perilous[,] unforgiving[N]
cold lands.[.6] Mercenaries are all the same:[AN]
the moment we take out their superior[,][N]
they have nothing.[.6] That is what we must[N]
focus on:[.4] the soldier giving orders.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
Alright[,] Captain.[.6] I'll get everyone[N]
in position.[AN]

[FL]
It is advisable to stay on guard[,] even if we[N]
have a preemptive strike.[.6] We can attack[N]
with two forces split across the river.[AN]
It would certainly aid us in securing the[N]
villages.[.6] There is no greater duty for a[N]
knight than to aid their loyal citizens.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Pause]I used to come here a lot[Beat] Before[Beat][.6N]
It's not very far from the Great Bridge[N]

It was a quick respite from the[N]

He said it was like Wreyvine itself;[.4][N]
[ToggleSmile]it's a miracle they grew at all in[N]

Wreyvine's lands are much harsher than the[N]

You don't feel cold at all?[.6N]
You don't have any doubts[,] Affogato?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
If you say so.[.6] More importantly[,] are[N]
you ready for what's up ahead?[6N]
Will you stay with us?[AN][Clear]
I've lived this same war twenty-four[N]

How did an Aeterian soldier become[N]

Nobody else is here to listen.[AN]

What are you getting at?[AN]

[Beat][AN]

[ML]
I was sent here as[Beat] an Aeterian spy.[6N]
I never realized until I put it all[N]
together:[AN]
who my arrows were aimed for[,] what I[N]
was tasked to do.[.6] Aeteria sent me[N]
to assassinate the Wreyvian king.[AN][Clear]
I was supposed to regroup with the division[N]
that was directly targetting the king.[AN]

[MR]
I had the suspicion from our chats[,] but[Beat][N]
Why are you telling me this[,] [OpenQuote]Affogato"?[6N]
You're an Aeterian infiltrator.[AN]

[ML]
Because you're trustworthy.[.6] I was attacked[N]
and lost my memories in the process.[6N]
Will you help me recover the rest of them?[AN]

That is simply our royal duty as knights[N]

to fight with our lives for our beloved[AN]
kingdom is our greatest honor.[AN]
That is what I know my mother and her father[N]

are what our striped scarf represents.[AN]

Eh[,] I don't get it.[.6] You were born noble.[6N]
I was just a criminal[,] then a headsman[,][N]

Now those who spit on me call me 'Captain'.[6N]
The royals[,] people like[Beat] Gorlois[,][N]
