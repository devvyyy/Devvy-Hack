Villager Guy
General, may I ask what forced your hand in imposing such extensive military presence on Omios? There are so many soldiers; daily life will be disrupted beyond measure.

Wulfric
I understand your dissatisfaction, but Omios... Nay, Aeteria is in a state of crisis at the moment. Seeds of rebellion are upon us, and it is the imperial guard‚Äôs duty to defend the city. We have no choice but to declare martial law upon the empire.

Villager Girl
Trade and commerce will stall... Is this truly the only way, General?

Opal
I promise you, this is necessary to maintain order in Omios. Please stay within your homes until you receive the signal.

Villager Girl
I suppose there is no other way... May your steps be safe.

Opal
Moonlight guide us.

Haye
What a sorry sight to behold, the entirety of Omios being herded by the shepherds. I‚Äôm sorry you generals were demoted to... city duty.

Opal
Major Haye. Do you bring back results from your scouting?

Haye
Yes. I encountered the rebels themselves.

Opal
Hah! How serendipitous that you would encounter them on your lonesome.

Wulfric
Proceed, Major.

Haye
Of the two curs that were there‚Äîas I presume you have heard‚Äîone must have informed you of what happened. Furthermore, I found the rebel‚Äôs‚Äô former hideout‚Äîthe village of Arma off the coast. I intend to return there for explanations and to ascertain the rebellion‚Äôs next move.

Wulfric
I wish you luck, Major. General Opal and I must continue to pursue the rebels.

Haye
For Aeteria. May moonlight guide us. (leaves)

Opal
Sigh..... General, what do you make of the rebels?

Wulfric
What I think, Mala? They‚Äôre a group of misfits and delinquents who intend to harm the empire.

Opal
I cannot say I blame you. But... I cannot help but feel dissatisfied with the Duke‚Äôs rule.

Wulfric
You cannot be serious... Would the Silver Serpent reborn turn on us?

Opal
No, of course not. But I keep thinking, and my mind stirs... Will they truly hold to the ideals they preach? Will they put a stop to the rampant thievery? Protect the people? Show mercy in the face of helplessness?

Wulfric
General Opal... You have only mellowed with age... yet your sense of justice remains.

Opal
Hah! You accede so easily, Wulfric. I would simply like to test their ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Come now, it is time to depart. Let us forthwith meet these rebels.

Raya
Hey. Are all the preparations ready, o leader? If I was Graham, this is where I‚Äôd say something prudent about checking the time.

Chiffon
Yeah. We‚Äôre all ready to go. Our forces are in position and ready to breach into the city gates.

Raya
So it seems. I doubt our fights ahead will be as short as those tussles back near the village. Aeteria wants us dead, but we have to prevail.

Graham
You have done excellently quite so far, but I daresay this is where we measure your worth as a true leader for the Liberation Army. We must race through the entirety of the capital city. We have two days. One misstep and our rebellion breaks apart	.

Raya
Uh-huh, yeah yeah. Nothing‚Äôs 'breaking apart‚Äô here, Malcolm.

Chiffon
I will not disappoint any of you. In time, we will reach Wreyvine. I will reclaim Omios as our first step‚Äîand then we reclaim the empire from the Duke‚Äôs grasp!

Raya
You‚Äôre really into this, huh? Alright. Let‚Äôs see your determination in action.

Chiffon
Might I say...

Raya
You don‚Äôt need to ask for permission, just say it.

Chiffon
I think it‚Äôs best that we avoid the Generals. We definitely don‚Äôt have the power right now to take them both on.

Graham
Alas, what a shame... But what if I suggest that we are in fact capable of doing so, leader?

Chiffon
It has to be too risky, right? The consequences of failure greatly outweigh the benefits. Even if we defeat them in battle, I doubt they‚Äôd lay down and just fall.

Graham
Yet if we can take them out here, it would demoralize the empire and reinvigorate the rebellion. I am sure we can make use of their equipment.

Raya
And... Chiffon. We aren‚Äôt savages like the brutes from the kingdom. The Imperial generals... I can tell even their faith is wavering. Hell, if we can convince them that our side is right‚Äîagainst the ex-Duke‚Äîthen I‚Äôm sure we can get them on our side.

Graham
Do you truly believe that the generals of the empire can simply stand down and be swayed to our side? Letting your guard down for even a moment can lead to our ruin. Focus on the task at hand, Ser Chiffon: we need to enlist Wreyvine‚Äôs help. That is all.

Raya
We can do both, Reverend. There‚Äôs always another way out.

Graham
If that may be, the choice is yours, leader.

Chiffon
(The Imperial generals would definitely be valuable... But they‚Äôre against us... How can we convince them that we are just...?)

Generic Soldier Guy
General. The rebels have been spotted down south of the city.

Opal
Then the battle begins here. The woman steering the ship of battle to turn the tides in her favor‚Äîthe mercenary with the golden eyes‚Äîwe have to remain wary.
Keeping sure the denizens remain safe must be our utmost priority. We must act defensively‚Äîonly move as a team if the rebels approach us!

Generic Soldier Guy
Yes, General.

Thief! Thief! Someone help us!

(camera moves to Wulfric)
Cursed vermin taking advantage of these[N]
times of war...[AN]

Generic Soldier Gal üò±
General Wellington. Shall we give chase and pursue the thieves?

Wulfric
Nay, we are ordered to standby until the rebels approach... It may seem foolish, but those are the Emperor‚Äôs absolute orders.

I suppose this observation was fruitless. I suppose Wulfric was right about the Liberation Army...

Chiffon
How was our performance, Captain Raya? Do I make a viable leader in your eyes?

Raya
Heh, you‚Äôre not bad, kid. This is a job well done.

Graham
I believe we are right on time, leader. Your performance was excellent.
(if all thieves were killed) Stopping those brigands was forthright; I am sure even a simple act like that caught the attention of the Imperial generals. 

Raya
What he wants to say is that it was satisfactory. Good job, we don‚Äôt have any time to waste.

Chiffon
We‚Äôre really in the thick of things now, huh? The Gates of Omios are just over that way.

Raya
Is that fear coming from your voice, leader?

Chiffon
No, Captain. It‚Äôs nothing but anticipation. Follow me, everyone! Let‚Äôs get a move on!

## 2-3Ending2
Opal
How problematic yet... Never in my years of service have I seen a group as rashly intrepid as these. The city front is safe and under control. The rebels did not leave as much of a ruckus as expected.
(if 2-3 side-objective was completed) They even... gave assistance with clearing out the brigands.

Wulfric
Have you really fallen for their charms, General? These so-called ‚ÄúLiberators‚Äù--they may have done some good, yet they still cause naught but trouble for the public that they claim to save.

Opal
Perhaps it is less of their charms and more of their efforts. A rebel force united with cultists and sellswords... A strange combination, is it not? And there‚Äôs one of them who interests me in particular... The one who seems to be leading their forces‚ÄîThe arbalest with the golden eyes. Her seemingly mystical powers‚Äîit may be of interest to the Trinity.

Wulfric
While that mercenary bears frightening witchcraft, the rebel army is still nothing compared to the Imperial forces. Shall we give chase?

Opal
Indeed... Yet Aeteria continues to assail the kingdom instead of protecting our own... Lead the way.

## 2-4Ending3
Haye
Citizens of Arma Village, I presume you have an inkling of where the Liberation Army is... given that Arma hosted these renegades?

Villager Guy
Major Haye... We‚Äôre innocent... We never saw even a single trace of the rebels.

Villager Girl
What‚Äôs with the torch? Do imperial mutts raze villages now?

Villager Girl 2
Yeah!! You‚Äôre barking up the wrong tree, Major! Move on! There‚Äôs nothing here for you!!

Haye
As people of this united empire, your cooperation would be greatly appreciated.

Villager Girl
Why don‚Äôt you just do your damned job instead of hounding people?

Haye
It‚Äôs strange. The rebellion was stagnant for quite a while... I wonder what could have brought them such a second wind? They say among them lies a mercenary with golden eyes who recently stepped forward to lead them. You would not happen to know any information about that?

Villager Guy 2
No... N-No, of course not...

Villager Girl 2
Quiet, you...

Haye
Now... What is that? A maroon cloak bearing the Blood Moon? And that? The criminals must have left in a hurry.

Villager Guy 2
.....!

Haye
The rebels were sighted around the mountains. They have also been sighted in Omios, disturbing the peace of your fellow man. The village of Arma housed these rebels and let them scurry away... In that aspect, you are all just as guilty. (sword noise)

Villager Guy
S-Stop! Have you lost your mind?! Drawing your spear on your own people?!

Haye
We are all Aeterian; bound by our blood and the Serpent‚Äôs light that we honor...

Villager Girl 2 (ok it doesnt matter which villager is which just whatever randomize it)
Major. Please... The rebels are headed towards the Wreyvian border. The mercenary with the golden eyes... That‚Äôs what she said. That‚Äôs... That‚Äôs all...

Haye
(sheath sound effect) Thank you for your time. With our assistance, you ensure that justice can continue to be met. May moonlight guide us... (leaves)
(screen transition)
So they‚Äôre headed towards Wreyvine. What could they possibly be planning? Ser Chiffon and the Liberation Army... I will find you. I will exact justice.
