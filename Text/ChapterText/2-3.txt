[FR]
General[,] I question what forced your hand[N]
in imposing such extensive military presence[N]
on Omios?[AN][Clear]
With so many soldiers around the streets,[.4][N]
daily life will be disrupted beyond measure.[AN]

[L]
I understand your dissatisfaction[,][N]
but Omios[Beat] Nay[,] Aeteria is in[N]
a state of crisis at the moment.[AN]
Seeds of rebellion are upon us[,][N]
and it is the imperial guard's duty[N]
to defend the city's people.[AN][C]
We have no choice but to declare martial law[N]
upon the empire.[AN]

[R]
Trade and commerce will stall[Beat][N]
Is this truly the only way[,] General?[AN]

[L]
I promise you[,] this is necessary to maintain[N]
order in Omios.[.6] Please stay within your[N]
homes until you receive the signal.[AN]

[R]
I suppose there is no other way[Beat][N]
May your steps be safe.[AN]

[L]
Moonlight guide us.[AN]

[ML]
What a sorry sight to behold[,] the entirety of Omios[N]
being herded by the shepherds.[.6] I'm sorry you[N]
generals were demoted to[Beat] city duty.[AN]

[FR]
Major Hayes.[.6] You bring back results[N]
from your journey?[AN]

[ML]
Yes.[.6] I encountered the rebels themselves.[AN]

[FR]
How serendipitous to have encountered[N]
them on your lonesome.[AN]

[R]
Proceed[,] Major.[AN]

[ML]
Furthermore[,] I discovered their former hideout:[.4][N]
the village of Arma off the coast.[.6] I intend to[N]
return and ascertain their next move.[AN]

[R]
I wish you luck[,] Major.[.6] General Opal[N]
and I must continue to pursue the rebels.[AN]

[ML]
For Aeteria.[.6] May moonlight guide us.[.6] (leaves)

[R][CF][FR][CF]

[ML][LoadWellington][MR][LoadOpal]

[MR]
Oh[Beat] General[,] what do you make of the rebels?

[R]
What I think[,] Mala?[.6] They're a group of misfits[N]
and delinquents who intend to break the empire[N]
from the inside.[AN]

[MR]
I cannot say I blame you.[.6] Yet[Beat] I cannot help[N]
but feel dissatisfied with the Duke's[N]
rule[,] myself.[AN]

[ML]
You cannot be serious[Beat] Would the Silver Serpent[N]
reborn be the first to turn her back[N]
of us?[AN]

[MR]
No[,] of course not.[.6] But I keep thinking[,] and[N]
my mind stirs[Beat] Will they truly hold to the[N]
ideals they preach?[AN]
The empire is in a fragile state.[6N]
Will they put a stop to the rampant thievery?[.6][N]
Protect the people?[AN][C]
Will they show mercy in the face of helplessness?[6N]
What will the rebellion demonstrate?[AN]

[ML]
General Opal.[.6] You have only mellowed with age[,][N]
yet your focus on justice remains.[AN]

[MR]
Hah![.6] You accede so easily[,] Wulfric.[.6][N]
I would simply like to test their [OpenQuote]justice".[.6][N]
Come now[,] it is time to depart.[an][C]
Let us forthwith meet these rebels head-on[,][N]
shall we?[AN]

[R][LoadRaya]
Hey![.6] Are all the preparations ready?[.6][N]
If I was Graham[,] this is where I'd say[N]
something prudent about checking the time.[AN]

[ML][LoadChiffon]
Yeah.[.6] We're all ready to go.[.6] Our forces are in[N]
position and ready to breach into the[N]
city gates.[AN]

[R]
So it seems.[.6] I doubt our fights ahead will[N]
be as short as those tussles back near[N]
the village.[AN][C]
Aeteria wants us dead[,] but they'll find that[N]
we're tougher than we look.[AN]

[FR][LoadGraham]
You have done excellently quite so far[,][N]
but I daresay this is where we measure[n]
your worth as a true leader.[AN]
The Liberation Army must race through the[N]
capital city.[.6] We have two days.[.6] One[N]
misstep and our rebellion breaks apart.[AN]

[R]
Nothing's 'breaking apart' on my watch[,] Malcolm.[AN]

[ML]
I will not disappoint any of you.[.6] In time[,] we[N]
will reach Wreyvine.[.6] I will reclaim Omios as[N]
our first step.[AN][C]
And then we reclaim the empire from the[N]
Duke's grasp![AN]

[R]
You're really into this[,] huh?[.6] Alright.[.6][N]
Let's see your determination in action.[AN]

[ML]
Might I say[Beat][AN]

[R]
You don't need to ask[,] just say it.[AN]

[ML]
I think it's best that we avoid the Generals.[.6][N]
We definitely don't have the power right[N]
now to take them both on.[AN]

[FR][LoadGraham]
Alas[,] what a shame.[.6] But what if I suggest[N]
that we are in fact capable of doing[N]
so[,] leader?[AN]

[ML]
It has to be too risky[,] right?[.6] The consequences[N]
of failure greatly outweigh the benefits.[.6][N]
Even if we defeat them in battle,[AN]
I doubt they'd lay down and just fall.[AN]

[FR]
Yet if we can take them out here[,] it would[N]
demoralize the empire and reinvigorate[N]
the fire of the rebellion.[AN]

[R]
And[Beat] Chiffon.[.6] We aren't savages like the[N]
brutes from the kingdom.[.6] I can tell even the[N]
Generals' faith is wavering.[AN][C]
Hell[,] if we can convince them that we[N]
have the same goals[,] then--[AN]

[FR]
Do you earnestly believe that the generals of[N]
the empire can simply stand down and be[N]
swayed to our side?[AN]
Letting your guard down for even a moment will[N]
lead to our ruin.[.6] Focus on the task at[N]
hand[,] Ser Chiffon.[AN][C]
We need to enlist Wreyvine's cooperation.[.6][N]
That is all.[AN]

[R]
We can do both[,] Reverend.[.6] There's always[N]
another way out.[AN]

[FR]
Even if that may be[,] now is not the time.[6N]
The choice is yours now[,] leader.[AN]

[ML]
(The Imperial generals would definitely be[N]
valuable[Beat] But they're against us[Beat][N]
How can we convince them that we're just[Beat]?)[AN]

General.[.6] The rebels have been spotted down[N]
south of the city streets.[AN]

[MR]
Then the battle begins here.[.6] Keeping sure the denizens[N]
remain safe must be our utmost priority.[.6][N]
Remain wary and act defensively.[AN][C]
Only move as a team if the rebels[N]
approach us![AN]

Yes[,] General.[.6] May moonlight guide us.[AN]

General Wellington.[.6] Shall we give chase and[N]

Nay[,] we are ordered to standby until the[N]

[MR]
How was our performance[,] Captain Raya?[.6][N]
Do I make a viable leader in your eyes?[AN]

[L]
Heh[,] you're not terrible[,] kid.[.6][N]
This is a job well done.[.6] But I'm not[N]
singing your praises yet.[AN]
The rebellion still has a long way to[N]
go until we're free from the[N]
empire's grasp.[AN]

[FL]
I believe we are right on time[,] leader.[.6][N]
Your performance was excellent.[AN][C]
Stopping those brigands was forthright;[.4][N]
I am sure even a simple act like that caught[N]
the gaze of the Imperial generals.[AN] 

[L]
What he wants to say is that it was satisfactory.[.6][N]
Good job[,] we don't have any time to waste.[AN]

[MR]
We're really in the thick of things now[,] huh?[.6][N]
The Gates of Omios are just over that way.[AN]

[L]
Is that fear coming from your voice[,] leader?[AN]

[MR]
No[,] Captain.[.6] It's nothing but anticipation.[.6][N]
Follow me[,] everyone![.6] Let's get a move on![AN]

[MR]
How problematic.[.6] Never in my years of service[N]
have I seen a group quite as rashly[N]
intrepid as these.[AN]

[ML]
Even with their frightening witchcraft[,][N]
the rebel army pales to the Imperial forces.[.6][N]
Shall we give chase?

The city front is safe and under control.[.6]

out the brigands.[AN]

[ML]
Have you really fallen for their charms[,][N]
General?[.6] These so-called "Liberators"--[4N]
they may have done some good,[AN]
yet they still cause naught but trouble for[n]
the public that they claim to save.[AN]

[MR]
Perhaps it is less of their charms and more of[N]
their efforts.[.6] A rebel force united with[N]
cultists and sellswords[Beat][AN]
A strange combination[,] is it not?[.6][N]
And there's one of them who interests me[N]
in particular.[AN]
The one who seems to be leading their forces[,][N]
the arbalest with the golden eyes.[.6] Her abilities[N]
are nothing short of mystic.[AN]
In any case[,] it may be of great interest to[N]
the Trinity.[AN]

[ML]
Even if they bear frightening witchcraft[,][N]
the rebel army is still nothing compared[N]

[FR]
Major Hayes[Beat] What rebels do you speak of?[AN]

[R]
We are but a humble trading village[Beat][N]
We didn't glance even a single trace of[N]
the rebels.[AN]

Am I supposed to place trust in your words[,][N]
given that Arma hosted these renegades?[AN]

What[,] you going to put us to the torch?[6N]
Do imperial mutts raze villages now?[AN]

As people of our united empire[,] your cooperation[N]
would be greatly appreciated.[AN]

Why don't you just do your damned job instead[N]
of hounding your own citizens?[AN]

[ML][MoveLeft]
The rebellion was stagnant for quite a while.[6N]
I do wonder what could have brought them[N]
such a second wind?[AN]
They say among them lies a mercenary with[N]
golden eyes who recently stepped[N]

You folks would not happen to know any[N]
information pertaining to that?[AN]

The rebels were sighted around the mountains.[.6][N]
They have also been seen at Omios[,] disturbing[N]

Since then[,] their leaders have been[N]
rounded up and captured.[6N]
Where are the rest of the stragglers?[AN]
The village of Arma housed these rebels and[N]
let them scurry away[Beat] In that aspect[,][N]
